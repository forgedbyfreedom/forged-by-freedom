Day 1, technically day 1, in New York, New York. Everybody is up, it's 20 past five, we're going up for an hour. Adam has somehow miraculously slets through the commotion of the kitchen. Taking a look at Jordan and Harry both in a really, really good position. After a 70-hour flight, there's some tendency to order a little bit of water. We've flushed all the three yesterday. I'm used to not sure, but I read it, it's just a whole lot back. I had a look confident that there was bare minimum water held, which is fantastic. Just planning the load for today, we're going to start today, it is Wednesday, Saturday. So we need to get a good influx of food in both of us, soup, and stuff like soup, and so on. Harry's a prep, although today, all the time prep, low. So it's about filling filling, give these boards some food, some sort of very happy about it. So it's good, good, 3 meals in, and then hit gym, I'm not too sure, probably hit diamonds gym, or whatever, scoop around, we're up to 12 hours from bed, which is a little bit annoying. But I think what it is, I've got more to cut you in the gym. I'm going to put some more food in the gym, and then some more food. So we're going to get back to food and bring them. No, I don't know when, or when, or when, when, when, when, when. Just some food and see how we go with that, and then for that point we can just take it. Oh, I want to make it by meal, and just make some treats on me and eat soup. This is the fun part, the guys are still tired of getting food in, but everybody's against how far and they're actually to eat and drink when you're late in the summer. I know it wiped out. Thing once it gets it's like round, they're going to be okay. Give me still, give me got it! Two guys disappointing, I'm just kidding, don't worry. Give me a little bit of food, don't worry, I'll give a little bite. The food has also increased, and much more than you'll find. Cool, we're nervous. That's going to be ugly, man. Yeah, three meals in. Both flat-spuck sick, man. But in such a very, very, very good position. From here, everything is easily manipulated. They're right where I need to be. A little response from the food. Go and have a sleep and go in, you know. It's good to see both for happy. Yeah. Even the level flat and hungry. But they both know the process. They don't enough time and I was going to work out just, yeah. Locking themselves in and just, you know, just getting them easy, resting. Getting all the fluid down. That's the hardest part. Probably pushing it was fluid in. Over the food. Keep in the... Oh, man. That was good. Yeah. That was a good side. I think that was a good side. I think that was a good side. I think that was a good side. It's a little ban from England. Thank you, gentlemen. Anyone? I got someone with friends. Yeah. I've been a driver. Then it's a little... I'll see you in the perfect. Home the money for where we are. They won't nearly complete the harrow. Jordan and his sleepers, that's all looking at me now. But we're now adopted the garage. It's freaking amazing. Four people. And I'll ask the pose of her in the stove. This is Chuck and Point. It's a life-thousand quick-to-go. And Harry will be a money. They will draw a level for that. And we'll stop through that. So, on the old days, we'll go. On the old days, we'll go. So that's 600 grand before I distinct off the day. And we'll go back to the garage, rather than day. It's just fun, right? And let it go. Let it go. We'll go back. But we won't know when they're asleep. The harrow's asleep. We don't expect to be. And I wish to have a long period of time to be fit in the stage. So it's just a garage that I didn't have in my no-one. We're going to plan. You've got a good baseline off the stage because of the joy. So you know the base line run way for the next few days. And then there's the very small two-tier one now. For us essentially, I'm good for that. So we'll take it over during the second one. And see how we look in and then hit this thing. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. What are you guys? Day two here in New York. It is... Just six in the morning. I've been up for about 10 minutes. How are you? Probably been away. I was waiting for his feet. We've... But those Jordan and Harry, hopefully, they're really, really good spot. Both dry up, a little speech fell out which was good. He's still got TV, so he's a two-for-way guy to us. Just fantastic, but at the momentum, we're starting to make him up now. Now we have a solid baseline to work off. The response from yesterday was good. We're pretty much going to replicate. It's more than one. We're staying on our feet for both guys. But I've literally, there are a couple of me who's at a time and just make sure everything's going to plan. We'll be training after me, we'll get a good look in the gym. We'll see the gym. I've never quite quality American gym. I'm very, very good posing room as well. So we get a good indication of the guys can see themselves as well, which is always a good thing. Just to see how things are coming together, we have a confidence boost. At this point, you're naturally starting to get in the head a little bit, potentially. If you can start to see things coming together, as an athlete is a bit of a win. We're not stressed about the load. You're not worried. It goes a level below. The body then still becomes very responsive. So that's key for me. Just reassuring the athlete, making sure that everything's a good point. And these guys are doing a very well on the body. They're tough enough to get into their 200 grams of course, but there's a flat-chisey and peanut butter jelly sandwiches for breakfast. Adam is a serious athlete. And I'm just a bit of a bit of a plan. Then check in, man I said, so we will probably catch up in the gym. I'm going to do push today for both guys. So we'll be going to see some forward in the chat, wherever they're. Yeah, catch them. Yes guys, we're back here at Sigmundshire Fitness. What an effort place to be out with now. Why is there is crazy? Guys are in for the push session. Just move the blood around. We've been that top show set in this. And see what it looks like. Coach work out. Those are really good. So excited to see it. And that I like, again, just going to you. Left through some light exercise. Nothing crazy. We want to see who the people that would have liked it in this gym, put them to their body. So let's see what it goes. It's getting exciting. And it's a big transform and body out. Yeah, see that. See that. Okay, what do we have to read on the first? We said like, we said you're going to be 1500 knots. We're going on the first week. We've got a lot to do. We've got a lot to do. Okay. I got a lot to do. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, guys. So just had a look at Harry in the posing room in a really good spot. Night and day difference from yesterday's look when we're only three meals in. We're now. Oh, we've got six probably two thousand two hundred grand cards in. And we did very, very good amount of water. For the ex comes alive, which is what we want. We want to a delayed response. Everything's where it needs to be. God game time for the rest of today, which will then put us in a even better position tomorrow morning. First of them be able to to pack off a little bit throughout the day. Clean up the GI. And then probably spiking up any even. So, the manipulation of what will be controlled as a visual from the point to point. Jordan is just literally doing his last set now and then we're going to go and have a look. He's, I can already physically see, he's a lot fuller just wearing a t-shirt, which is a good sign. So, when we get in the pose and remember he's still going to come alive, we'll hit three or four rounds, getting working. And yeah, we go from there, then while there is all the rest of the days planned for him, see how he looks, the see of him as well, and just make some fun and adjustments that need to go into tomorrow. So, it'll be pretty cool. So, it's time to deliver it, try to see it in everybody, apart from how are you doing it. Sorry, maybe it's not. Just coming to the end of the day. Let's go as up on one wheel. Take a look at him in the garage. I'm not even literally cool, so, see where we're at. Then just make the sign and cool for tonight and down to four minutes. So, apparently, there was tomorrow, and half four, five o'clock. See where we're sitting at that point, and then just start to plan the first couple of days. But my body's responded, and then from that point, freezing. I think, it's hard and awfully scratch, it is around about six and eight-ish. So, we've done a bit of a new set, we've got a couple of hours. Head back, and that should be enough. We have in Detroit. Okay, we'll stay in Detroit tonight. It is a shake off today. I'm just a peach munchie. Delicious. It's a retired body game. Yeah, it's a shake off. It's a shake off. Hey let's continue to quit the video first. Let's do this. I'll pay you one more time.

Hey guys, welcome back to the YouTube channel. We are here in glorious sunny Spangua, okay we're here in Alicante. I've been here since Tuesday, I was many of you here Monday, but right now I've been in the flight, my pastels damaged, but easy yet a good as golden, let me on so I'm here luckily, Jamie arrives on Tuesday evening, we stay that mother goose is, thank you mum, we chilled there for a little bit just rested. Jamie was coming off the back end the last week shows back to back over all winds, you know, just holding a bit of fluid from that. Hello, bit of a stomach issue, which cleared thankfully as well. We've shifted over here to El Planteo, the place where we always stay here in Alicantee by the VB spaces where the show is going to be held. Jamie's in a fantastic spot, he's just getting dry, a harder fuller by the literally by the hour, it's crazy to see such a good position to be in. Very easily manageable from here, we're just about to head off to the time finnist for the last session, literally just going to move some blood around and hit some rounds of pose in. Have a good look, see where we are and then from that it is literally chilled time up until the show tomorrow we've got a massage book then just over there, then flush free other than that the mum and his literally is going to sleep and then eat and so perfect position to be in, we're seeing the jump. Yeah, oh, I love how we are like, come on my gol 뭐가e I will be there okay I'll be there We have a good, good, good, good. We have a good, good, good. We have a good balance. Yeah, it's our first time. We had to first show this to shoot the number of people. Yeah, and that's a big impact with that. That was on the show. You know, that's like how far I doubt it. You know, so you prefer to get that time and you know, you can, like, say, be friends, I would like to think to this because the body is, you know, you're reapspacing. I'll get knowledge about that. Um, do that now... Yeah, cos this is car Garcia. I'll try hiatzefEsair. I'm so sure. Yeah, see that, i think?atto. Don't tease him. It's not an added effect on the face. This is the best way of being made to love Martin. It's a good way to get rid of the dust. It's a good way to get rid of the dust. It's a good way to get rid of the dust. It's a good way to get rid of the dust. You can compare the taste. It's a good way to get rid of the dust. It's a good way to get rid of the dust. It's a good way to get rid of the dust. Jim and Dunn and Dust did the last workout here. Jim is loom fucking ridiculous. Full blown. Like we're in the power set position. So we set a rough guy like him. We guys to knew it was so today. Put three in pre. We had a reasonable day yesterday. The fullness that I seen this morning was good. It's just got better out the day. We moved some blood. Everything's held pretty much where it needs to be. We've not seen any depletes show. We've not seen any say it off. We guys are that fullness. Which person is in a given front-passed position. Just be able to pull back a little bit. We got three meals now post workout. We just had meal thighs. So there's only one more meal to go. So we're just pulling back a little bit now. With the weight of the body composition is in the moment. It's perfect. We know in the morning. The look is very, very good. And by tomorrow morning to be even better than this morning. So yeah, we could have been about to spot right now. We're still 36 hours from stage, which is a long, long time in the week. You know, especially at this point of the week. And now the Jamie's feeling good. And just happy. That's what he needs for you. He's tired. We had a late one last night. So just going to hit the sack and just chill out for the rest of the night. And then you're missing. That's all your body needs is just for rest now. And just go like this. Give you back into a position where you're just chillin there. And more I look alive for tomorrow. And then just cruise through tomorrow. Small changes here in there. The possible bargaret of fries. The tomorrow night. We know we know once we're really well with Jamie's physique. So the day he stayed. We can pull back for you out the day tomorrow, which is a blessing. Because then it tears the GI. And then we know that we can shock him in the evening. We can do a good high calorie meal, which is going to work wonders. We've traveled it last week. And the response was fantastic. So it was different scenario. We've got to back to show us. It worked just from seeing the visuals from that. We can we know we're confident going into this. That we can utilize it. So we're just finding games there. We're going to follow. So we will touch base in the morning. In the morning. In the morning. Yes, guys. It is Saturday. They were foreshows. We are just going to head out to Don't see Monica who's going to do an influx for Jamie. I'm going to show you a bit of a stiff shoulder sort of transfigure up. And then we're going to have a little bit of a stiff shoulder sort of transfigure up. And then head to registration, Tand. They're using a fantastic spot. Worker performing dry. Laying for an extra soft. As expected. Always happens. It was able to get a couple of good meals in the morning. They were just backing off again. Just keeping that balance as fullness. And then it's allowing the water to dry the body. We've just had a quick look now. These skid and dry by the hours. Just one touch. And this was one of the most fullness was a GDSA. And it's just about keeping that. And then just keeping the balance and just trying to suck all the water out. Ready for tomorrow. We still got probably. A good 204 plus hours until he's on stage. We'll just assess me or why meal. We'll see how he's looking after the side when the tans on. And just give us that again just a better indication of how things are looking. Go from there. So. Catch him back. He's going to just yeah. Move long, rather. Shift index causes negative speed. Nice. Alright, I came to fight these199 years! Break that mood to us. I've got to be looking at my soul. 10-4 years ago. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Well, it's clap. And before the boys get their bag guys, we are here at Gui Coat. I think it's pronounced in Alec County. It's pretty epic. Wait for the feed, the feast. Registration done. No turning. So, too much of Jamie's joy. Time it will be done. It's three cos tomorrow morning, which is freaking fantastic. So, we've scored a sleet. Not stressed about being sticky and sweating is harder. So, that's another of the bless. We are in a position where Jamie can be fed quite a bit. We've driven down through the day. We've kept it quite very tight. You know, if the body is there, it's pretty much ready to rough. We just want to take top up tonight. We're just going to hold it for tomorrow. It's a pull off the water. Yeah, it's going to be exciting. So, we're going to be excited. Sam is joined us. He's grabbing himself. He's immense. He's probably the tool that I have. No idea what class they're going to draw. So, probably the tool is class. He's looking sick. He's done the apples rolling himself. So, he's a now feed in himself as well. So, let me get it. We're going to get it. We're going to have a bag of this. But yeah, it's very much as a smart. It's a good show. It's very, very good. I think that's a good show. We'll see what happens. Well, that's one of my favourite. I'm going to try it. I'm going to try it. I'm going to try it. I'm going to try it. That's my favourite. I'm going to try it. It's not a biscuit base. It's like a cake base. It's a buttercream. Big. Nice though. It's very very. You can tell it's baked up from the crust. Let's see if we can see it in a different... ... or a restaurant. Last one you have a competition. This should just traditional Spanish tea. If you've made one, right. There you go. Hey guys, yes, it is so late. Everything's there. We're ready to rock. Really in a good spot right now. It's going to be a good show.

Okay, just not the result, but we wanted to tell you me that that's the incredible line up was crazy. It was a great place for the in and on bias trying to be in an unbiased edition was a little bit harsh, but that's what it is. Jamie Bork is best package. Who just wasn't the lead they were looking for, which is body building at the end of the day. So we rolled on and we've had a sit down and a chart and we got a couple of options but we're not making any solid decision just yet. We've just got to in. That work is now 25 to midnight. My pieces are taking whatever we are staying here tonight and then tomorrow we fight in the York. So we can't show you the side of the deal.

Yes guys, we're here at Primate of Jim, the YouTube is back. Season is over. So we're going to make more training videos catching up with Harry today. 16 weeks out from Detroit Pro. So we're going to get an arm session in. Being very careful. I'll slightly a bit of an injury. I've got a little bit of a lost territory. I've got a lot of stuff in the back. I've been here with a couple of weeks. So hopefully that'll be good. We're going to have an in-person check-in. See where we're looking at. I know we're in a good position. We're in a very very good position. So to see if my own eyes, then I'm going to get some content for the ground. What's that? It's down for me. What makes I think it's? Yeah, come on. You again. Again. Again. Again. Again. Nice. Go. Yeah. Yeah, come on. She's out. Come on. Yeah. And again. Go. Yeah. Yeah. I've technically chosen arms today. I've probably thought about the only thing that might be able to keep up with Harry. And we've got us on music level. You've got to watch it pull about six-bates with horse, what wide-brake, so that's exactly it. In just my outfit, I can't do it. So I've had the increase of volume. Bit more reps. Yeah. It's the same as the tempo down. You've got to train smart. Yeah. Yes. First of all, I think there's a certain train to get away of the younger, like in your 20s, you train more like, like, rather, like, sorry, and style, like, probably on failure. Then we get over 30 small, he-hainy, like, stimulate not a lot of, yeah. Yeah. Train, like, evolve with your body. He-he-he, basically, as you get old, trains smart. Yeah. Yeah. I've got my head. Hey! Nice. I've got my head. Nice. I've got my head, this. I've got my head. OK. Nice. OK. I'm feeling good. Yeah. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. Come on. Oh, my God. Oh. Oh. Yeah. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.

The acoustic press on the front. I think you'll have that habit. So would I just do this? I'm going to do it. It's still giving a concentration on the tricep. I'm not fully locking the elbows out. We're not low. We're not low. No, coming to play by more so written than you've really drive. It's keeping the front tension on the tricep making sure that the track really doesn't come to play either. Very good movement. Very good compound movement. I always good on it. I'm low. Come on. Yeah, screw it up. Drive it. Yeah, come on. We've got a whip. Come on. Go. Come on. Come on. Come on. Go. Come on. Go. Go. Come on. Come on. Go. And again. Come on. Come on, man. Get it hot.

You're gonna go back to the office. Yeah. Well, what's the name of this? Snack. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good. Good. Good. What's the deal, Frank? You're not talking about that. You're not talking about that. You're not talking about that. Keep moving. I'm just getting flat brakes. I say last week, we're just... We'll just pull last week, I'll do the first thing full. Then that immediately, we're dropping water, maybe feel a bit tighter. Yeah. And the last couple of days, right, we've dropped a little bit more. I feel a little bit slid. I know, don't, obviously, in the poor spectrum, but that hasn't prepared to what I look like. I feel like skinny fact going. I'll say, you know, we're fine. It's nice to learn how to make things. Making things. Making the life. I'm fine with it, guys. You're in fact on the moment when that's made, we're getting to share shows. You know, like, oh, yeah. It's just trying to explain it to us, it's impossible, yeah. Go away from here. SCARTS Get off. Go away! yeah yeah oh Yeah, that's been all to change. Yeah, yeah. Well, it's part of the process. Oh, I'll come up. I mean, we'll reach the boat. Yeah, but then you're always running down our own. Yeah, yeah, I'll try and do as well, make sure. You come down in like four octaves, you'll be following us two weeks and a half. What's your new trend? Zoom, Zoom, Zoom. So, and maybe you spend a half an hour. Probably, probably, that's giving us a lot of work. Yeah, yeah. I meant nobody knows about that. So all the times. I know, so that's what they want to bring them up to. So you can enjoy Christmas. It's still a wrap. But it's just what the history is. Yeah, and they've been with that. Yeah, exactly. It's the day off. We'll go, yeah, I'm fine. So I only take Christmas day off in the Greenwich Bank. Three and bucks today. Anyway, yeah. There's always a good day off. And hopefully that's a nice episode. We've got a really healthy day off. Yeah, I mean, to get through one day, and we'll talk to the new needs of the routine. Right, so yeah. I get a bonus for that. You know, there'll be a good quad. And you're back in the play. Yeah, yeah. I mean, in the needs of jumping to get better now, so I've got them well to just maintain just on the flip. You only done three sets of the leg extension, three sets in the hamstring leg rest. What you want to do, last short, three four months, which is a good, so just when we need to get there, hopefully, I'm going to be able to put back in the hamstring. Maybe I hope you'll barbell, course, my family. No, exactly. A week point. No, you want to. Thank you. You still want to feel that? You still want to support the position. Yeah. I'm going to move the blood around it. I'm blessed to have you in the doubles with the details. So we'll do tell you that we've done it. And you might let your quad-ratching, one of the last things coming from your action, you need to get virtually destroyed, least for I get those quad-cells. That's what people are seeing. When they do come in up to that, they make them look like they're big as us. That's good feedback for me as well. Like, that's what I'm trying to get. But you know, the starting, I'll be looking up for the front. Yeah, just that fucking quarter three next time. Yeah, I'm so excited to look at different ways of my back shots coming almost to a view. And we're still looking at the back. I can have straight hamstrings, to loosen up, if they lower back in. And I still have more to come up from the front, which is the way it can be, it's able to hold around you. So I just need a little bit more time for those quad-cells. You know, coming a little bit more. And that's where I'm with the timeframe that we've got. We've got that time period to bring it in. Almost solidified that condition. And it really good. So when I'm chasing our after, the kick-up, I think that's the fact that. So, especially with the amount of shoes, depending on how many shoes we want to hit. Yeah, keep it going. We want to keep going as long as we can. Yeah, that's another thing as well, like I said, that my physique generally gets better. The more shoes I do, I don't tend to burn out. I get better and better rather than, yeah. You know, doing a show and then getting worse, I'm going to go get tight and start it off. And I'll go. To be fair, mate, I'll find that a lot with the top half needs. Because I always say that you can go 100% and then start for a show. You can be a 100% but then once you've had that little bit of, you've been on say, you've never been to that little bit of respite, you've got that sort of next. So, get a gas to push it to the next show. And you can almost speed out that next year for a cent like. Yeah, so then take your on and on and on. So, don't worry, come hang some of that. Yeah, yeah. So, I always believe in that. You know, it would have get better. It was a wide barrier, it was perfect. It's like, you can only push the body so fast. Yeah, it's actually great. And you're starting up from a different start from the, you're pushing it from a different postshow and then again from the night to check your tyre, you can get down from there. So, you see it back into the time that they do. Some of them need to do what they keep with you, for example, makes it do a couple of more of your favourites. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know that, I know that, I can line up four or five shows. But know that you've put it in and put it in and put it in. It's going to get managed there. So, run it to that. Yeah. And that'll be very much like you. There's a lot of you manage this period. And give you fresh, fresh as you can be. And fresh. Yeah. You can get managed. And you just keep that for three of them in control. And then you're all in your stuff.

Hey guys, we are back in the UK here for the British Firenler's here in Manchester. It is packed with a bunch of prevention so that it is buzzing.

You're just going to have a vaccination. I was probably going to have a vaccination. I've already got about five minutes to the guys on stage. I'm going to be so excited to see some of that happening. So apparently a lot of good players come over. Wow. So we're just going to see what happens. See what happens. They unfold. Everybody's on the money. They've done everything. They can't. Can't see. You're a bit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, don't. No. Double mindset. Black Spray. Face front, overhand of the envelopes, and your favorite most muscular. Back in German, you can follow up. Please, long give your next competitor one zero wave for side coin. Blacks, quarter turn to the right. Face the back. Double bicep. Relax. Quarter turn to the right. Face front. Back in German, you can exit. All right, Juggie, tell you how many back you reached. That's our 35 and 40-light up. That's our boys' bicep. Juggie, face the back. Double bicep. Face front. Overhand of the envelopes. Your favorite classic for Zipos. Gentlemen, back you very much. That is pre-juggie wrapped up. So, Baron, like heavy. Just hiding a bit of in today and there were some freaks in that lineup. Jesus Christ. A lot of guys with hollow legs. Very very good standing in light heavy. So, Baron, unfortunately, didn't make the top five. Looking at probably six places in that lineup. It was ten in his lineup. Maro, heavy weight. Fantastic lineup again. We're looking at potentially second. Good squeeze first, maybe. It was like close. The column line is in that line. He's looking very, very good, very sharp. So, it's a matter of just seeing what they're just saying at the finals. Shortly, we're probably about an hour away from that. And then, ReStavis, fantastic. Took me master's classic, plus 40, class. We have a game plan moving forward to him. Today was a bit of a warm-up interview. We've worked together for such a short period of time. We now are in in to Romania. Okay, four weeks later, I'm pro-baller by Hugo for it. There's a bit of a card. We're in to see what the result is from Maro. If it doesn't come to you today, let me go again in two weeks. Germany. And Darren is on his way back to the apartment, because he is on stage tomorrow now of the PCA Finals. We've catch up in a bit, post-finals. And we'll go for that. This is how legends are made. Please welcome your next guest. See, Mooru, Mooru, move ahead. Third place fellow, Pittsburgh sent it to one, e-eleven. Brother Slav, cost it enough. That's self-remeral goes to your heavyweight runner-up competitor, one, zero-seven, Mooru, move ahead to the body building overall. Your heavyweight chat, Kielo, bye. Two rows of British finals. I'm sweet. We are done to the day here in Manchester. Smudge on the cart head down to Talford. Good day. It was good finals, Maro ended up with second place in the heavyweight. Fantastic note, Kielo. A little bit sharper again. The finals, however, they obviously didn't judge. There was no good parisans running in. So it was just a good to see how well he proved again from last week's. That came in the quarter-ghosts. Yeah. Please, with everything today, everything's gone to, well, part of it obviously not taking past places, but everybody was happy with their results. Everybody looked fantastic. Now on the TCA bridge, we'll see you. Help it. That's it. Nice. Nice bro. Nice bro. I'm going to play some of them. Fullness tonight, and then back off tomorrow, we'll be trying to keep showday as obvious as possible. I'll be able to do it. Probably get it never me in and then I'll lay back on the fly. Yeah. So we took six meals, plus the burger for us. Yeah. I think maximising the fullness. Now we'll go crazy on this last meal. We'll probably just have to chicken them rice. Or what we got. Yeah, I've got everything in the bag. Yeah, because that was a hundred seconds chicken. But it's a great rice and bingles. How many bagues do we want tomorrow? I mean, you got me the man. Then go up three or four. That'd be fine. We got rice cakes as well. We got two packs of rice cakes a sandwich, just got the one. Yeah, we got bagels. I'll definitely make a quick move. I think we used chicken and rice just for the next meal. I can cook rice for the morning as well. Yeah, if you need any more rice to it. How much rice do you got left today? I've got enough for tonight. Yeah, so tonight we'll be able to now. You're four-jump grams, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So, three four-jumpers still have a little less. And it's not from should we do another rice for tomorrow? You can do just because it's going to be a long day. If you want to cook one up, we'll have probably a cream of rice meal in the morning. And then probably a chicken of rice meal. I don't have a cream of rice. I probably just do an easy one. Yeah, I'm sorry, I didn't know more rice. I know you make a room cream of it. Do you like it? Yeah. Any longer drawing drawing? For the whole. Real up. You're right. You've got some, I like six, six, thirty. Yeah. You're just looking to experience a pain of butter. Never hungry butter. Yeah, it's a good one. I've got you know the cast, and we talk. Yeah, never. Keep running, you're drawing that nicely. You keep going. You hungry. Yeah, I can start. I'm really in the sense for you. So, yeah. I've been in the flowing meal. That's nice. Hardly. What would you like just make me draw a load from here? Yeah, I've got some bits to do with it. Okay. Hold on a bit. Let's have a look. Yeah. Yeah, and you saw that that you just make sure this is what it's showing. That's it. That's it. That's it. It's going to be nice. It's going to be nice. It's going to be nice. It's going to be nice. It's going to be nice. But at least that'd be longer than it. We've worked for you for your house. Go for him. Yeah. We've just sitting down for a lot of the car for an hour and so just bought a lot of back into the easy answer. We're going to get very close in here. Okay. That's a bit. That's a bit. That's a bit. Um. It's not just. It's going to be two seconds I have thinking. Um. What's next on your plan? Chicken rice. 154 grams chicken. So rice. Yeah. So if I was chicken, I think. So I think. I think like you can push large fries if you need. You're going to have a bit of a little bit of a bit of something. They're really digested and stressed by trying to climb a ball in. Let me think. Yeah. If I take. I'm going to stack the cheese under. And I thought you should have one slice of cheese. Yeah. I'm going to even do something. Yeah. There's going to be enough fat in the. Yeah. Yeah. Honestly, if I just have a burger. Yeah. Bread. Yeah. So yeah. I'm rather not. Yeah. There's going to be enough fat's food. We're a burger itself. Yeah. Sounds good. Sounds good. Yeah. Make sure we go into our guests in our lives. Yeah. I've got some. You know, bought some of me. Yeah. I've got some with me. Yeah. Um. If my eyes are next to it. You're not trying to. I don't know if I can do that. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, you can. You can certainly. Put that in. Um. Just going to bring you more to life. Sure. For us. Yeah. Through the night. And then tomorrow. Just hold in that. I'll see you fast in the morning. Sure. I'll make one meal in. Yeah. I'm just going to sit well. And then just grow. So we have landed now in Tauber. We are at the holiday in. And I am lost. I think we're going to speak. To reception. Possibly. Um. Just being to see Alex Andrew. And George, all of you fantastic. Wait for reception. See you. Find shack. And then see Steve. I think that's it. Who's staying here. Who's there on you. Stay in Manchester. Yeah. Everything's looking really good. Taubering on day. But everybody's happy. Just get somebody's eyes getting very hurt. Right. But every time I get. Um. I'm going to eat today. And then I'll just put it in. Yeah. Um. I'll say. Currently. Just trying to find our way to reception. So. I'll show you a bit. Breathe out out before you get into it. So we're going to. When you're here. Yeah. By the time you finish the end of your post. Yeah. You're going to be all the air out. You don't any. You don't. You don't any air here. Push it out. When you're facing this way. You want to be like. All the way out before you head into that post. Got me. Sense. Nice. That's it. Yeah. Nice. Do you feel like connecting a little bit more. Yeah. You're going to pass it for your back. We all out. Sick. Nice bro. Yeah. Yeah. It's good. Yeah. Hey. Hey. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Now you're going to want to show that condition through the midsection. Your strength is pulling that back and making your waist narrower. And your then top line is expanded. Okay. So I think working with that on your physique is going to be an advantage. You can see that you're going to benefit us. Okay. Certainly. You know I'm saying, but you don't work to our strength. But the guys that you're going to be going against. I'm going to do this. Yeah. Front double. Yeah. It's a bottom part. Perfect. And that's what we need to do. I think that's that's your strength. If we can make you this. Because we're not going to get caked in dry. Okay. These guys are assisted. You're not. You're going to be on the money. We play through the strengths that we've got strengths as your level and pop. Yeah. Okay. Your top line. The amount of tissue that you can display. Yeah. And if we can make that look crazy. X-raying. That's I think the the the the run that will approach us with. Because. There's going to be some cute guys. It's a very fun. And I mean. You condition is there. But your look is bubble. But we're going to be. That's going to be our benefit. Because I'm going to have the. I'm going to have the help of you. And that's what you have to do. That's what you're going to do. Cause that's what you're going to do. You're going to do that one. And you can do that. You can almost hide your breathe in. Does that make sense? With that front arm covering the midsection. Okay. You see that on the same. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All these little things. We're going to go. And I can't. Obviously on that stage we've got somebody to go up there. little cool control your transitions steady plow within. But it's not too much now but there's a few today that's all with. Yeah, I think that's gone. Yeah, and for us if I can maximize fullness tonight then again tomorrow we still don't need food. Yeah, just an hours volume. Yeah, I mean so, hit your... So in time, yeah, do that on again. Yeah, perfect. Go on and make. I've got to go then. And if you've got to last me or me, is that if you're last me or me? There's no of them here. You're five in any? You're five in your zone? Seven, five. One. Yeah, cool.

So let's see what she looks like now. Hey, face bro. What a turn to the right. What a turn to the right. Face fun. Thank you, ladies. I'm just a winner on our own. And that is another day done. We are finished. I'm done. The end of that day. It's been a very good day both. Very long. I've been here since 7 o'clock this morning. It's now 7pm. Everyone, it's much super heavy, incredible lineup. Took fast pace. George, super heavy weights. Game at fun, toss it, line up, smash that first place, and then battled in the overall and George took the pro cards. So a very good day for the 13. Yeah, we should give it half to you. Because they both deserve the pro cards today. But unfortunately, just the one. Yeah, then I'll start on the evening, or see she's done masses and open. Second in her class, but she's not upset because she's put the better package to speak. And even the judges said she's come back so much better. And people are always very positive. So people are going to be a prize in the off season, and then she'll come back. We're good. That's it. We are going to head up to Stafford now because we have the PC, it's nice to have you tomorrow. But for now, we'll catch you next time. Thank you.

Hey guys, welcome back to the YouTube. It is the Ben Weed UK Pro Polifier weekend. It's Friday afternoon and registration is in a couple of hours. Less than a couple of hours now. One and a half hours. It'd be a very precise look at that. Florian upstairs here. Very, very hungry. Under his cap waiting to be weighed and registered so he can eat. Luckily, Josh and Florian are both staying in the same apartment block. It's fantastic for me, I'm following this down the road. Been more than 13 years since last night, every couple of meals to conclude your different approaches. It's just cool. We've Josh coming off the back end of the first regional couple of weeks ago because we've got some really good data. There are things for me into places as well. There's a few in honourable eased in honourable, I don't know, I can't say the word, the fat word. Going into the regional which we were able to spin around and bring one out of the lip to that stage, very condition, bubbly, physique. He's already in a bad position now going into this show, which is good, I'm so afraid. It's a very good lineup in Super. Florian, class B, class C. I already know that it's going to be a very good lineup in class B. A couple of other good guys in class B as well, so I'm excited for it. It's going to be a good show. Coming off the back end of Fibo, last weekend, I'm still very hyped on the so close so close. Two is an LMP qualification, a private input in place with him for the minute. We should be going again very soon. Don Fibo, fantastic package, Dom's best look. Two day, he's in the class of 15. Of course, that can place unfortunately. It's a bodybuilder when we enter the day. It was a close call, but he don't very well, and again, planned to be a bit of a place for potential returns to the stage at some point soon. So, I'm going to go and check out the guys now and then go from there and we'll see you at Reg. This is a good, he's about the kilo under on his scales under the wake cap. It's just about to have a look at Jocelyn. So, just checked on the guys, Florian is looking very good. He's super flat waiting for some food, desperately hungry. He's only had about three eggs and literally in total 200 gram per chicken. And about 500 grams of nut butter, about 500 ml water, all day. It's now an hour away from Reg, and we're below the cap holding nicely. Meals planned, but one meal, big meal planned to get in. You just got to be careful because I'll see you in the position where we need to get food fluid, so we're going back in and you got to get it at the right pace. It's not about just completely just overloading in with food for the foreseeable overnight into the show. It's an early show tomorrow. And he pulls a great vacuum as well, so we need midsection to be super tight. So it's about that balance of getting the right amount of water in, sodium and then a comfort of the amount of carbohydrates over the period of time. I'll probably haven't feed enough until late, smaller meals, rather than just sort of just maybe into a three meals in. That are really big. Again, just seeing how it's stomachs. It's Josh's looking really good. Very happy with the low, the body's responding. He holds fullness so well. So in a position where I'm able to even pull carbohydrates, let the diarrhea's process really sort of take effect because you're not adding carbs into the equation and then be able to spiking up a little bit later on. So it's exciting to watch the favorite part of me. I'll be yeah, that's about it. I've got a couple of guys on in Scotland tomorrow doing Naba Scotland. They're in Chris, both looking good. I'm just waiting for their update after meal number four each. I think they've got a big hook. It's all good at those things just joking. So look at that now, get his next meal planned out and then note out Chris will be checking in at some point soon and then get him ready. For his next meal and that's about it. Four guys on this weekend all hoping for good results. Lemonbuster brof. Five minutes. So it is registration time. Florian is very hungry. He's comfortably under the cap now. Well, hope he is. This guy was a reading wrong. I'm going to look mad. But yeah, everything's looking good. Josh is just chilling. He'll make his work at some point zero stress on his behalf. Very much in a good position. We're going to get this done feed Florian put 200 grams of carbs in in pretty straight away, pretty straight away with a little water in total mixed with his core and to drink. This is so the end back in him and just bring him back to life. He's smart. That's all part of the process. Funning games making weeks up. Not as fun as what we've done last week with Monzie that was a pretty damn crazy beer. That's another day. Yeah, it will go Oh, check him in a minute and then find out what Josh is. He's good. Huh? He's giving him some food. Are you his now? All right. Yeah. Thank you. Perfect. So Florian has just made way. Kila went there with T-shirt on so we just wanted to become the book because recently experiences some skills we different some people hype from. So just making sure there's additional stress and we've got to run away and drop a Kila we'll see. 200 grams of carbs are now going in and Florian is very much enjoying that from cream and rice dates. Fruit, rice cakes, honey and yeah. That'll do sit very nicely. It's very similar approach to what we've done last week. France, Ray Warnier of Rural. We'll do this. Last week we played it a little bit tentatively because of the chance of the rebound coming off the back end of the show. We've been traveling as well and just wanted to smooth process. So it was about 85% last week and now we go 101% so the peak can now become as more fun because I can deal all in with him. So yeah it's going to be fun. Josh is on his way so we'll touch base with him in a minute. The guys don't get tired for about an hour and a half or so so they'll head back to the apartment and come back in a bit. Yeah so maybe game time now. Florian Josh, yeah kilo under with T-shirt on. Is it heavy? Yeah. Are we having a view that more? Yeah we're still like, so how much do you got left Or will you't have a woman like us trying to out? Yeah, just put another grandma and she think that is swimming quite well. I can't. No, no, no, no. I'd rather just let that go through and then as soon as back on me, like, I'll work out what we're going to be. I'll have a look at you after tunting. Again, just seeing how that shift in. Okay, and then go from there. Just chill for a minute. Half an hour, hopefully you'll be in tunting for 30 minutes. That is registration done. The boys are tunting. Just some of the little and both and they are both looking very, very good. Very happy. I've got two guys, Chris and Dan now checking in Litchie as on to in this. And yeah, they're looking brilliant as well. So all the plan and Josh's joy a lot. Josh is on chill mode at the moment because we're going to plan a big meal in about an hour of 15 minutes. Slawian needs to get home now and eat. There's a couple of meals that we're going in and then we have probably a little bit more of a calorie dense meal in the back end of tonight. Just so then sit well for tomorrow and then see how it looks and that is it? We'll catch you tomorrow. Show that you. Yes, guys, good morning. It is showday. It is, possibly even telling the right time. So on the by time. It's cool past 8 in the morning. I've been up since 4 o'clock. Check them the guys early. Got a meal in super early. Just really because the only show star we just want to make sure that everything is perfect. So can't waste any time in the morning. Josh's getting tanned. It was top coat, Florian, little over there just waiting to hit the stage. He is perfect. He's ready. It's a bit good day. Chris and Danen, Scott them two guys up there for Peter's Day and then Abbas Scotland. They've checked in this morning early. They're on their way to the show. It's good. It's going to be a good time out today. It's good athletes. They're going to be hitting the stage. It's going to be exciting. I'm going to head back stage with a good backstage stage of the tanned and now we're going to check on Josh. See how he's doing. where are you guys? the right. Clutes. Quarter turn to the right.

Normally the first couple of meals, like, I feel a bit heavy, and then the hunger kicks in later, but a straight away, the first two meals I'm starving. Which is going to be, and I was so empty this morning, like, here, like, and I've seen a drop of keto from yesterday. So, like, my body was like, I'm ready for this now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Thank you, Steven. So that is it. Session wrapped up Maro. I'm just joined us all the way from Portugal. Just done rounds with a guy here and that is fantastic. I'm happy to be here. I believe everybody is very, very good spot. It's Thursday. This is something to Sunday. But from what I'm seeing, everybody is at their best this point. Really is the everybody in the position where they don't need a sandwich feed. And they don't need a sandwich dry enough. So it's almost just like cruising into their show. From the very easy, easy to control with meal to meal. Across the next three days and it's just landing it on the day. I'm very excited. I've literally two scums all the way through. It all feels like a big positive sign. What do you guys are happy? They're feeling at their best feed over done. You know, they're looking at the best they've done. And definitely we can ask this. It's a good to hear. But I look like that. There you two, Alacampty Cup, a striding morning. Guys, I've got a meal in. I don't look at them this morning. I'm running a very, very good position. We sort of semi-loaded yesterday just because we know the show is going to be late on Sunday night. It's actually shifted even later. They're going to probably have 910 o'clock at night. I do. But we sort of plan for it anyway. So it's not a problem. We're going to go in. They will have their final session now. Just move some blood around the upper, take a look and then plan the rest of the day. And we're going to go to some meals. We'll have a couple of meals now. So we know where we are. It's just then stoop in the hammock. I need now for the rest of the day. So we'll see you there. Me and Alacampty Cup session in last night. We're having a train. A little bit of dogs. I'm actually going to go back and train at the things that we've said. But we're going to go back and train. We're going to go back and train. And that is it. We've done it. It's done it. It's final session of the 2024 season for Mark and Lewis. Had a good look. Post post workout. I'm so tired. So loads of looking fantastic. Dryer filler. Both very happy with the position we're in with a couple of meals in. And it's all going to plan. We're going to go back. Lewis will be able to set out. Mark's out. You can hear rivals. Mark and Terry have just arrived. So we'll catch up with them. We'll catch you later. Have you done the weekend with them? Alacampty Cup. We're going to be on the right hand. We're going to go back. We're going to go back. We're going to go back. We're going to go back. What are you guys? We are back again at the train. We're going to go back. We're going back back. We're going back. We're going to be on until about half past nine. Possibly teleclock tomorrow night. The game plan is to pretty much shift. Everything. everything, a few hours back, so meals are late and they go to bed late, wake up late, it's tomorrow and it just shifts that timeline which unfolds in half a day with the show will be in later. We've come here just because we've got the same light, Abba Al-Qamaro, Lewis and Mark, all fasted, first of the morning. I can plan out today, the meal, two meals at a time will then come back here, rinse and repeat. Everybody's at different places, everybody's got different protocols, we have a forward, and it's something that we have to manage literally just as a point of just seeing how the body responds. meal, pamele and pimele were warm and a little bit in it and the other good bits. So we're going to have that now and we'll set everybody up for that first meal and then Monica has either come into us or we're going to have massage, myor is not registration, we've then got athletes meet for athletes meet at 4 o'clock, they planned out so we catch a bed all the time. Yes guys we're here at VV spaces. We have some help stumbled across a rest-living. Big man is setting up, and it's probably a bit of a start in the end. So we see how on time that will be. Everyone's on point, everyone's really, really much in an excellent position where we're just literally just taking it meal when we all... Everyone's getting dry and we'll get in there. So we'll be Friday to where we're running the ring. But that was good dry and it's getting very exciting. We are all about 30 hours up from here. It's going to be happier. Yeah, because everybody's out in the reception area. It's probably the most happiest scene a lot of Hollywood in the long-term. There's 26 open guys. There is actually more open guys in the community. I've showed some of the show tomorrow. Everybody's in a good spirit, everybody's in the same of the future, everybody's in a real good vibe. So looking forward to it. It's going to be a good backstage and a kind of way to start. See how I've been going to make those. Okay, he's long-term so we're going to share with you all. He's going to take that into that circle. Okay, looking forward to putting on a very interesting show tomorrow. Thank you, Martin. Thank you very much. I'm sorry. We're going to get out for no-no evening when I'm smart choice. I'm from the UK also. So it's a fun call that's in the little community with me, supporting NWP, but out here because we're about you and us. We're able to organise this. It wouldn't be a show basically. So this is my first show. Definitely improved on each show. So hopefully we'll get good time on stage. We'll be rest of the careers. Thank you. And I'll show to the rest. Thank you, thank you Martin. Lloyds. Good evening. Very excited to be here. This was actually my birthday view of years ago. I haven't improved massively since then. So I want to say thank you to a million everybody. Put on such an amazing event. Madison, all the judges and the IFBB because without them we wouldn't be here today. And I am very excited to showcase what I bring it tomorrow. And that's everybody wants to jump up on stage and do a preview night. Or you can wait for tomorrow. Thank you very much. Thank you. Yes guys, so we're here, we are back stage. A VB space is it is show today. First up, we have obviously, it's the region, it's the pro qualifier. Maro is pretty much ready to rock. He is the best ever. Maro said to him, when we come off stage in Romania, it was the best and he said, he can't get no better. He said, he can't get no better. I think we've troubled it and it does look really, really good. It's a good way to finish the season. We won't actually do this show in after Romania and the excitement. I think he was just buzzing to get back up on stage. And now it's time to finish the season in style. Very happy, Maro is happy. We should see what happens on stage now. We should be a couple hours, but it looks there now. We just hold it and it's good to go. We're on the boys this morning, early doors, when the Titans seem like they're set for their first couple of meals. Whilst I'm here, and then as soon as Maro is finished, I'll be running back home to check on them. And then there will be a late tonight, so they're just going to be sleeping and eating for the minutes. So, all is good. Like we do before, you know, right, just make sure this is good. Top yourself up, three, four rice cakes. Yeah, everything's there. Everything's there. Everything's there. There's nothing left. Like even when you sometimes do that, and you get a little bit here on this one, just everything's like home dry. And because you're posing better with that rear last bread, as well as holding it and nothing is spuckin' perfect. Absolutely perfect. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yes, what do you think? Writing books here in FAA' That's all we do. We don't expect four ice-creams to come. I think about five minutes, 60 minutes. Right? So we're doing a lot of work. So with the event, but I'm going to do some drives to the van to share. Everyone thinks it's going to be a lot less. So, okay, it's not worth going to do some straight-line but I must have to show a good book. It's where a lot of people are wrong. And they keep feeding themselves before they go on stage. So they're working. Right, so they want to get the money to go on a get-a. Honey, everything in. You know, we're in the Parvintz decision. But we're doing a track in the front of the van. We're doing a track in the front of the van. Well, what we do is we have to feel muscle left. So we're going to take the car. Oh, no, that's water. Is that water? Hello, hello, hello, hello! What are you looking at? Help, help it. Yours, Maru! Here! Yours, yeah! Welcome! Try something this and give them a word. Control it, Maru, control it! Come on, Maru! Yes! That's fun!

So, offstage, Maro so close in the overall, the one is class out of nine. I think it's nine in the class in Heavyweight. Really good lineup that we've really expected and some good guys out of Maro dominated the heavy season then went into the overall very close between the Heavyweight, like the Super 4 rounds, 4 full solid rounds and Maro left to Maro that's sentenced to the end. So heart rate went up a little bit and unfortunately they give it to the Super, they do have the opportunity to have a super happy, thank you for everything. We're in turn to the right. Thank you. Maro, thank you very much. Maro, close seven. What if it be nine? Yes, three, three. Can I hear it? One, six, ten. In the air, in the air, all that. Class, face to back. The winner. Class for a gentleman. Face to back. The dollar pose. Relax. Two, seven, six. One, six, five, six, seven, five. Tristan, in the side. Face to back. Okay, gentlemen, double-bice. Class, one, eight, you want six, ten, three, spread out. Four, spread out. Double-bice. Class for a gentleman. Face to back. Six, six, three, spread out. Yes, guys, so this is the official wrap-up from Spain. It was a very late night. We finished. We got out of half-ass one. It was a great show from both Mark and Lewis. Both, incredible package. Maro was there. He actually won the heavy weights and was that close in the overall for the pro card. Show of the year for Lewis, the last show of the year for Mark. Both had incredible seasons and I'm very excited for both in 2025. Plans will be putting place. We'll get them working and we'll be showing up for sure. A few different shows picked out probably for Lewis. Just trying different avenues, different countries. We'll catch you then. This was probably the last show of 2024. But plenty more to come in 2025. Subscribe.

Yes guys, welcome back. We are here in Las Vegas. The home of Hollywood in the legendary Dragon's Fair. It is, say, one here. It's a pretty hot, untired. We just got a drain, so it's a dope, okay, Lewis. It's depleted. He's looking absolutely fantastic. That's like a job weight quite a bit. Following the bar, I guess, it was in 1400 grams of cards in today. Let's go for the twack. Let's go for the twack. Let's go for the twack. Let's go for the twack. Let's go for the twack.

Yes guys welcome back to the YouTube channel we are here at Hassard though condition coaches here in May then head we have a multi mascot we've leaned it or it's come up come with the Airbnb and other ways oh he's not happy he's not so we're already going to hang around but it is the weekend of the condition coaches kingdom classic first show that the UK season the regional it's going to be a good one I've heard it's probably the biggest starting show the year for a long period of time so I'm very excited Amanda's got a job like a company and she's a good mate mate girl she'll be her travelling not seen and so I'll look at her then that's going really well she'd been ready for while so it's okay so if them jump up for the regional she does get ready for the Ben Ween and a few weeks time so we've got touch with us we've got Jordan and we've got Alex we have more room to cut we are doing checkings we're getting some food in we're gonna then head to graphical get some content get some filming get some training done and then we are off to registration cut you there so this my first meal which is three eggs three egg whites and the hum and 20 dollars eggs I am currently on 5,100 calories per day predominantly carbs that's quite low for me last obviously I'm at the pressure up to 5,9 but I'm able to grow on a bit left this life and he's special recipe for the eggs me just new coming the pan and then take it just fry the pan mate you're setting the oven you're setting it it's still on the oven but it in the same way chaos okay I was frying morning checking days hurry it has just checked in he is looking crazy looking very very he was three weeks up Detroit Pro given my high dates more 1500 grams of carbs should be tripped nicely and put them down yeah it does in about one tripped faster to the state never been to Detroit so excited that will be on YouTube probably episode three of the season so stay tuned sneaky preview for Jordan I can very good very good anyway so that is eight so let's New York Harry's also going to be doing New York so we've got couple guys in New York I'm just gonna make some moments to Jordan's plan he's done and my fourth yeah he's far he's been on well it's not ideal in prep anyone he's an unwell in prep just gets in there head a little bit it does affect you mentally but well you have the reassurance of your coach and just knowing that you do everything you can main thing is you also need a taking the consideration as rest and recovery even though you want to go full war in a prep scenario it's something that you have to think about you know then so body's not responding you're not gonna get the results that you want to see so just a few relations never's planned we've got you guys must go in on pre-work engineering muscles passing through our control I'm not ready. You're here. We are here. I crafted some. We are going to train. All eggs. Password training? But. Please. As always. Mynda training. Girls training, please. Guys training legs. Guessing training content. Thank you. Next. So we are in hamstrings. First, little bit of a quad touch up. We've all been traveling. Satin cars for a long period of time. We've been last couple of days. So, best thing you can do before you do any sort of full leg workout is a bit of flexion. Hipaduction. Open up the glutes. Allow the connection for the hamstring to be that little bit better. Always find it works. Absolutely. One of this. Just setting your leg up. Absolutely. A lot of people miss us out and tend to take it on at the end. But I feel that the crucial exercise just to really get things going. Get the blood move around the legs as well. It's like doing calf raises sometimes when you're doing quads. Just really stimulate the blood around the lower leg. Especially if you're squatting. I find that if you have that stimulation you tend to perform a little bit better. You're not as tight through the lower before you go into your movement. Just a couple of like pointers that I always say to my guys. Like, best thing you can do is just try and set your session up for max. More optimization. By doing these little things before you're sessioning, rather than going full steep. Which is probably going to just do make real do it. But if you think smart before you go into your sessions, the progress that you can make moving forward would be optimal. Yeah, like quads mate. Speak to that. I'm not afraid of it. No. I don't know what I'm trying to do next with East Bucket. It's on my bodybuilder already. I don't know what I'm trying to do next with East Bucket. It's on my bodybuilder already. Silly. So I'm trying to do the half of the weight. I think quite work. What do you want? Drop it down. I'll say 65. 10. My figure girl. Yeah, like white. I think. Oh. Nice bro. I'm still got it. I won't even attempt to get my legs out. I'm not doing fucking quads left. Nice Alex. Good. I got it. Good. Yep. Free what? Get that. Good. Ow. Whoo. Good. Thanks, Louise. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. Come on. I need a squeezing. Yep. Come on. Yep. Easy. Come on. Oh, that's. Go on it. Drop that on it. Sure. I'll put this one on. Because I feel like it makes it shorter. Yeah. You know, when you use the machine like this as well, depends on your height. It's a way your foot doesn't going to be. So obviously none of this machine moves. Where some of them, you can move your foot. You can move this this is totally set. So you're going to have to find your sweet box. Where you don't want your knees come and over. And you're also going to lock fully out of the bottom. Some find your foot. There's a way you really feel like contraction. Is it hot? I have no idea. Yeah. Yeah. So as far as I'm going to tell you, I've come a little bit slightly off to stop that new flesh as much. And what you don't make sure you don't do is tilt out the bottom. And when you're coming up, we don't want to all rest. And at the top of you down, you want to keep that contraction through the glutes. As I'm going to, good point really helps is your first couple of reps. Keep in that pause at the top. Really feel the contraction. In for like five with pauses, then really go for reps. You'll really start feeling better. Nice. It's a nice machine, isn't it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. She like it. You see a hamstring drop. Ah, you see her here? Oh yeah. It's really telling me all of that. We're talking about hamstring. No swearing with you, this PG. Yeah. I've always been really slow. And really concentrate. I think the more you come to check with glutes, that's a key. As soon as I stopped trying to connect, like mind-section, I just lose all feel. Yeah. I've got to just raise the zone out and really think right, glutes, glutes, glutes, glutes. Feel the burn. Nice. Nice. What happened? She's up. Wow. Nice. Come on. Nice. Easy. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Come on. No, it's not, it's not like宝宝 • Donate It's you You forgot the noodles It was all you did I'm so tired He Tony is listening !​ Here's a baby Is that ok? Come on man. Come on man. Come on man. Let's go. Yes. Come on bro. Come on. Three. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on, let's go, let's go. Let's go, let's go. Leave him alone. Come on. Let's go. Get it, let's go. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. 내가, wake up. Go. Let's go. I have to walk with it. I have to walk with it. I'm not. I use a tray. So Amanda's doing these for the buns. When you're handling them without a bun, the buns isn't actually doing anything in this moment. So I'm going to set it away from a little bit of feedback. And on your adi-out of what we want to put on is you want to contrast the glute. We don't want to come so we can come to ham-shakes eyes. We are going to be a sense of fully tar at the glute. You might find that you don't belly, can't come all the way at the floor. Just slightly below your knee. As soon as you come further down, if you think it ham-shakes cooking in, or you're going to just below the knee. So this ham-shakes formness slightly definitely for me. If she's at the way eyes do it, she gets too much ham-contracting because she's very ham-dominant. So by using it this way, very, very small range of movement. She's not controlled with the ham-shakes or the glute. Also, she's going to go into the soup set with the buns. So I'm not using it at a minute. Right! And now, just when the bun is that easy doing so. The buns look not anything in the face, that's nice. We do them all partial laps here again, keeping constant tension on the glute area. We're going to put the legs on top of the glute to the upper glute. to the upper glute. Masong like. I feel the same as me very well. Ah. I suppose that male choice is. So, Masong. Checking in Masong. I suppose that male choice. Well, I have protein shape for this workout. And now we have a scrambled egg. Some salmon. And the slices are bread. This is milk 3. And not probably the egg. It may have burgers like that. About the standard day prior to which I would know I've got nobody can be in. It's just, I can't say I'll just get everything set up. We'll be there for registration. I'd be at that. Very good. I'm going in. Yeah. Chaos. So, we are here. Here's a page ready for tomorrow's event. The condition coach came in the class. All the guys now have turned up for registration. As you can see, my speedy crowd. I measured myself. I've dropped. It sends me to again. It's night. Every time. I don't do the way. But I am now just under one five nine centimeters. Last time I was 160. I was going to get a smaller one. I'm going to get a smaller one. It's going to be a busy one. So, it's already looking pretty stark. So, it's going to be a good day. So, we're going to catch up with everybody. See you in a bit. So, this is Charlotte. Hey. So, she is now registered. She is tired. She is ready for tomorrow. This is also the lead up to the profile and two weeks time. Your first vision on Halloween? She is. And my first team was. Because I've only ever done. And we see it in the same. He's in the same state. Yes. So, MPCA, but in the UK. There's two birds. That's what we are today. So, everyone is going to call. I have a bit of a stressful day today. But we are going to calm down tonight. Trying to let stress be. Take a bit of a physical situation. We are going to be out badly. The 40th of a month. We don't want that. But Charlotte is going to go home and have some Zen time. It will be very nice. So, we will be a lot of sleep. Yes. It's a good night sleep. It's not a good night sleep. So, it's just like the one. Yeah.

Hey guys, currently we're done. Welcome back to the YouTube today we're filming a day in the life. So I know some of you always intrigued what coaches do. I'm a day today basis, it's not exciting but I'm going to show you. I'm just going to go for a walk in a minute, get some fresh air, it's burning up a little bit, it's very cloudy just morning. Go get a coffee or talk you through the day. So after the time I'd like to just go for a little bit of a walk, to the head, foam still probably not going to be in my hand for another, but it will be in my hand but I won't be working for about another 20 minutes or so just going to do and wasting the UK guys to start checking in with this handy because all of within the body or head of the time, which is very, very beneficial. Yes I've got guys have checked the information, I've cured them which I'll get back to as soon as I'm back in the room. But for a minute, just still for a walk, get some steps in, try to finish it before I have my first coffee, always like to treat the leer and a half before I have a coffee, I'll go for a few days a minute. But such you are a this is a food stack from the SN and I mean from the SN which I've got. The reason why I have a mean is as a weight, it's a little really for first two hours so I have that big of mean of dump in this drink and the aftly stack is complex, more of a bit of a more mineral and hydration formula, these works really well, takes epic. So I've been there for a five hour drink and a walk in the good behind the day and I'll have a big coffee, I've had a clever help, I've done a done cold turkey about three weeks ago and I've stopped all caffeine. I was drinking recently. Two or three cups of coffee today, two or three energy drinks today, I'm in a free workout stick, I'm not caffeine in time with this one around my family, where I just went and then I was on some take-in, which is some days my own in, to get the sleep was at least sleep, but that sleep helped with something else. It's not healthy waiting if I'm with the competencies I'm dying, I wanted a little bit of a adrenal reset so I'll put a little caffeine out here a little bit better. Tired in the morning, it doesn't get that kick, these are probably able to sleep better more effectively and what I'll probably start to do over the next few weeks is generally starting to reintroduce caffeine at a low level just to give me a good friend. I'll give myself back into this ring I think for a while I was going to be needing for the season. So this is what tends to happen, I'll look for a coffee and then I'll see what people with E.C. and the experiment that is really good, a hungry, a little bit of a two-act right, and I would devour this and then probably touch up my protein with some clear way back in the room. That's good. Done. So that's breakfast done in Dusty, but I want to breakfast, I'll finish part two and I'll get back. I'll do head back to the hotel room now, crack on with flying check-ins, certainly coming now. It's just not seven in the UK. You'll start rolling them and it doesn't get through them quite quickly. Typically, 15 to 15 to 20 check-ins a day, I do have a short walk. Then we'll go on crack at the moment, I think about 15 guys on crack three or four, five, six, seven weeks out. So their check-ins are quite regular at the moment. It's touching basically the cue and they're all pretty much on point for where they need to be. Regular, more regular, refeeding normal. There's a point for some of them, so the check-ins become again increased because all of C were where they're looking at the morning after post-war trial. A day after post-war count, the day after the, it comes in thick and fast and this is where the season really comes out. They've come alive and we are three weeks out from show number one and they are the Kuskulti's Cup. In Essex, the first two boat, two bros, NPC regional that qualify you for any profile of fire. So the illustrious player, maybe pro-card anywhere in the world in part from America and that should be in the ironwoods and a couple other workshops in the cupcake. But yeah, we'll get on with these coffee and we'll have that theory. So breakfast part two is the ice of clear from ESM. I don't like normally drinking, probably take on the room. And I'm never really like the me too way. But this from ESM is really well, tastes really well. There's no funny after taste as well, which is fantastic. This is a cherry lemonade that I think is a cherry blade, this is a moment of loss of the ice. So what I'm going to have to try and do is formulate some way of getting this in there. I think we use the whole one card with a holder to actually make a mess. Well, this is dead, just topping up. I'm going to put it there. There we go. Topping up some protein. It's only had 4 eggs. I tend to eat 4 or 5 meals a day. And then whatever else I found to you on top of it, I'm pretty flexible in my diet. I'll make pre-wreck out with the white pudding. Mix it with one of the blueberry or lime flavor and my free workout and what I'll do is have that and pick up some wheels from BIRUS and you can find that and that's enough the rest of the day. I'll do it half. Thanks here. I'll do normally cut in my little way cutter but the expert at the tip look is too tasty to this and this thing. The ninja which I'll show you in this later is a God-Sem's. I think I'm going to travel and stay in hotels and wants to cook or reheat their food. This thing is an absolute good thing. It's quite bulky the head of it but it will pack in a suitcase time. I'll fix glass dishes. It's not going to break. Make sure to shake it, get this in, start by work. Then the pre-work have been removed. My daily encroaching of tablets for the morning encroaching. The D3KT, the pressure of the cumin, the capsules, the dice of the box, the 5HCP in. The tablets and the portsiad Corneau have been glued on for warfare. We shall be avoiding the table. Take a 3N, and I'll show you the assistants right away. I'll take the mic all the time with the next meal. I'll do it again on the day, I'll make sure I get everything in there. So many of the other like the next and tablets I've got before I used to think I was in one but now I've been only probably doing about that. So that would be me doing the next lock in the middle too. We work out about to go in, but gonna make it a little bit sad, but yes, it's a good I've said a lot about this product, I don't know what I'm going to do. But there's a lot of water going to switch into this because it's subtle and it's so easy to make. The work way to do it perfect is literally in matter of just the way you have that in between three the amount of water in the water and the amount of the water. It's the same, the chocolate scales, the chocolate ball. Very handy. I don't have a lot, 60 grams. Perfect, I'm going to use this position, let it set. And then I'm going to put the line bar, and I'm going to make a series of crispy bits of syrup and actually in it. I'm going to put the jinn and a bit from there. Maybe I'll pre-work out and then have to do it myself. Because I've lost my sugar again, you're going to have to try and master the tunnels. It's going to make me work out. Pre-work out the choice is the non-stim crank pump probe again and the tray is very cold of flavour. The crank pump is good. And it's a formulation that's come out by yourself. They have just brought out the Wesley Visitors, Golden Crank Pump probe, which is again even better. Mine that I'll wait for me has just been to do it. So unfortunately it's not here anymore. Now that this is very, very good. I will take this for me and then make a whole reason for the jinn. I will use daily, okay, fantastic product from the SNP. I believe in the quality of the co-reaching, and we've heard of what we've got for a very handy, especially on the gole, and you don't have to then create a thing-loots feed collagen, which is very, very handy. And then these little beauties, the electrolyte sachets, and I will take this with me and I will pour a 1.5-litre bottle of water and dump that in to have towards the end and after training to replenish my electrolytes. So we'll try and mix all this up. We're going to make a horrendous mess. I'm going to have to buy a shake and drink. I'll go back to the dungeon and try and find my other shake. Today we're going to train at Bynos, as we'll be a push session, and we'll get it in get out of busy days. I tend to like to train on my own petions on. I'll give it a little bit of people. But when I'm very busy, I'm just going to get you in and sort of a very tight, it's more of a fact that getting the chop down and getting that hair, unfortunately. And I'm going to try and have a decent session. I'll put my food up recently a little bit. I'm going to come back from Jamaica, where calories work in a room at a higher level. I'll just try to maintain it and sort of try to train this and across the cleanest foods with your there, bargain in here and there, we're going to have to make it. I think it's good for a few kilos up. Just seeing some increase in performance, which is good for me. And it just sets me up for the start of the season, because as soon as I start, it's going to train and go down here. Just like bodybuilding, coaching is the selfish sport. If you want to do what you do at the level you want to do at the commitment to your guys, it's always done with priority, but you cannot look like a health. So just trying to get a good start point before the season is starting. I will neck this. We'll look where we have closing, but the day's very good. And then we'll have to be enough. So today's session push is going to be chest dominant. Going to run 43 chest exercises. Two out, maybe three out. And then I'm taking my day's skill, but we'll probably do one choice set in the size. Start with a good press today, because it's been okay. Normally I lower it in the needle through the basic tendons, and feeling good to start on press. I sort of will try to have between the fly and the press, but start on press today. And it's pretty old school. Four match just filled in weight up. Just really get a good feeling for it, and then probably just do two solid work in set. When I hear good weight. Do one more set in here. Then we'll probably do a flat press, and then do a fly. Just see how I feel, and moving into. That would further I do two or three exercises. We'll see. We'll see how did a little bit of an intensifier there. I've got a last set, there's a drop there, just because I'm the top load. I only got six reps, and I'm going to deliver it more free that. So just the way I've tried to get the most out of your session. Drop in the weight. Push it free. One more set, there's a sneaky tenon. Put the tenon on that one. I like the spins off, there I look there, it was the same sneaky tenon hiding. Always check your weight for please start. You're no longer a tension, and a back of that movement. Really slow down, it's quite light. I've got a lovely pet that I packed, I've got my six tenons. I always complain about, but it does limit me from pressing, so I just have to sync to mark when I'm training. And just again, thinking of a tactical way to make the load heavier. I've time in the tension, and then explode in that little ring. Yeah, you good? Yeah. Magic Electrolight Sunshine, so handy. oh ramadan at the moment so quite yeah quicky, not exactly but places it doesn't make meī very busy look at all the Vietnam Px oh give Go! Check the bottom. You know it's like trying to take that full range of motion, bringing the arms up high, trying to leave with the airway, not the rest. Just trying to fully engage the whole of the media ahead. I'm really good at exercising. I've got shit no cuts, so the dominant of my doubtwork will go towards the media. And then I'll put some anterior in there as well, just to top up with the air. Oh! One thing they don't do in half an year is a lot of 20 points, so here's a lot of 15. Fuck me! I'll do it back off, 15, so I'm in a hang-in-in-a-gift. Just drop one plate, just think smart. Be able to push through a decent set. Push done. I've already got some caston. The super set cast, standard of the C-A, hit them quite intense, lower them up, probably the best way. My opinion to do it, super set or a try set, turn on the HF. I'm actually one of the growing cast really. Frequency wise, I hit them whenever I remember. I tell my athletes probably at least three to four times a week. Well, I tend to say is if you're training up, one training day, training up, the next training day, the C-Cars and we'll take that for you program. And that's it. session done, dust it, about an hour. Grab some food, take some food home, and get back to work. So, post-work out meal today is my favourite from here. It's the Dynamite Chicken. Convenience for me. Can I have another 200, 200 rice please? Thank you. Convenience for me when I come here. It's just so handy. You can wear everything out to choice, fine selection of food. There's beef, chicken, shrimp, salmon, everything you want, and then the York. Bitch, two out to that, and then you got to take the super set or rice, sticky rice, full choice. For me, it's just a bonus, just to be able to have this all prepared. And then what I do is let people want me back up in the ninja. Back in the hotel room, fucker. Just sort of stay in the Airbnb. With 200 rice please, and could you warm that one up please? Thank you. Guys, you're good. Um, yeah, it's perfect. Perfect, excuse me, sir. Not quite. I'm sending you, because I'm going to slide back from the coping to the chicken. Okay, fine. Just to be honest, everybody's been in the hallway. It's like you can see the crash of across the fitness. And we have a week when it's closed. And I'm out of the limits. We'll know it's still getting enough out across the floor. And keep you fresh so we can be in that position too. It's going to be a good thing. So halfway through the surfing team was blocked. Time for me and one of the three. I'm working on the 20th. Stop. Stop. Do you have the hill under your free water? I'm going to ask them what I'm going to give you. So ninja, have brought out this wonderful design. Very compact everywhere. It is very, very handy on the camera. Fist in the sick case nicely. And practically I don't use it so it's full capability, because I don't actually cook them wrong. But for convenience, I cook on a re-heat. So we say it's got a re-heat, re-chris function. And that is what I use it for. I thought it actually takes some decent mirrors. War, not cold. I've got a fridge. I think they're there, which is not big. And then for the day we've got steak potato. And then we've got another fine and white chicken. We'll squeeze it in the fridge for a minute. But a little place on top. Set to... We'll put that about eight minutes. Let's go. We'll eat that. Finish off work. And then we'll head to the moon. Big so. Big ass. We'll do the big so we'll just go over it. Eight minutes. Don't have dust. It's not ready. See you. And this is what I do in my spare time. I'll train that hunting. It's not good. And these are in the sail. Two in spikes. Two in spikes. Two in spikes. Yeah, taking. Yeah, I can. And just like that. You do American Express? Yes. So that is pretty much my day done. I don't normally go to the moon. That scene is keepers here and he's not been. But we've clocked up some stats. I think I'm up about 13.5 thousand. Mostly accumulated in there. I'll go back. I've got a plan to start. Eat some food. I've got to keep rushing and get to sleep. I need some food in myself. And yeah. Get home in the master love wagon.

Good morning, it is officially, we'll call this one day one day one in Detroit. It is up us five in the morning, we've been out for a good few hours. I think we had the same with seven eight clock last night here. Two times which will then equate, see, midnight, UK time. So we're a bit over the place at the moment. I haven't looked at Harry this morning, he's super flat, weight is lighter than when we prior to when we flew. Little bit of water, but nothing crazy. So we're just going to manipulate this day. We're going to start the low-strait way, there's no point hanging around. I know Harry needs a lot of food, so we're going to push it. It's just shy of 1600 carbs a day. So the man is happy after 100 grams yesterday. 100 grams yesterday. Yeah, I'll say this is the first actual day for the whole prep of actually been hungry. You know, that could have been party because of lack of sleep, obviously. And the jet lag in a time difference is, but 1600 grams, obviously we use the same sources the whole time in prep. So it never goes down well, perfectly digest it with your well, no bloat, no any issues at all. So yeah, this will be absolutely fly down. Except that you've got the cookies, so we're going to have to get some cookies. Go to the manabroke pottox, maybe. We're going to get three meals in. Meal ones already in, two more meals in head to the original powerhouse gym. Which is going to be pretty cool. Meantime, I'm going to get back to my UK guys who are all checking in now. And we'll catch it in the gym. Okay, so we got 200 grams of dryweight Jasmine rice. That's a lot of rice. So we chopped up green beans, I like the kiddo vegetables in there just to keep my everything passing through in a digestion. 150 grams of chicken breast and a blueberry bagel with 40 grams of jam. Okay, so it's meal number two. meal number one. We had 175 grams of creamer rice. 25 grams of protein from way I slept. 40 grams of honey, 10 grams of almond butter and 100 grams of raspberry. Meal one for coach today is for whole eggs for egg whites and a very scrammy bagel, which is toasting quite nicely. I'm not sure if you can see it. There is no toast there and there is no cow. So I have to boil water on the hob, old school style for coffee this way. Okay, so meal number three. Another big boy meal. 200 grams of dryweight Jasmine rice. 150 grams of organic grass fed beef mince. Again some chopped up green beans in there. Further digestion. And I'm popping my pot type of ginney and the bread of pot type. So we're going to put the two of these down and let you know the are. So we are here at the original original powerhouse gym. It's a incredible place. A lot of the style to here. A lot of great athletes have come by here and trained here over the years. And this is one of the reasons why I love them. What I do come in place where they sit. We were around the world. We were a little bit more often just sharing that with them. It's crazy over here. Training a bit of pool today. Put the hurry through the rounds where q mu's deep into the load. And I'm just going to put some more off. Just give them a blood move in today. Push it a little bit. A little bit more than we normally were. Just because Harry's full of energy. So I was going to move those cars over pretty well. And then just think a good look after. So it's good to set it up. And then you can place it here. Right here they do all the family reasons. We're going to do that. What did that? I do it here. What did that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You have. Yeah. I think that's great. You can do this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going down. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Come on. So Harry is already given this a fun ticket but prevo some fucking here. Yeah. It's incredible. Why manufacturers decide to go so off the rails and we're going to try and move it about everything. Simple things. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And of course. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How is it? We're here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You so good. Yeah. How's it? Yeah. Oh seriously... Oh no.... Well.. So now we can definitely steal the doll with the ass..unden Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom woah its good i have to eat running Oh, no. Nice. Can you see that one a bit? That's it. Just a tiny little bit. Just make it different. You're putting it in three as you go. You're doing it that way. Just lock it in the bottom of your head. You're doing it. Sasha and Juan are in powerhouse complete. Three adults, by set. Done. Harry is feeling great. We're in the perfect position. We're like 10 or 15 seconds alone. Just on that few round of hours in. Everything is where it needs to be right now. For far too many people get caught up in the fact that I'm not full. I'm not dry enough. We've got those that we've got for all day. We've got 70 hours till we're going to be on stage. There's a lot happening up here. It's like a matter of which we're going to meet. It's like a little bit of a point. Like the moment. Today we're going to be about 16 underground archives in. Confident of that. We've crawled it over and over again. We know Harry was so well to it. This could be that's probably my really loaded point for us. And then it's about, let's see how that goes into the next day. See how much food holds us for back end. We are utilizing some natural garbage. And now he takes it out. We need to make sure we're getting the actual�ting as well as we start that process. And then it's just about trying to get that balance of fullness with the dryness that we want to bring. Harry, we want to bring him in absolutely peeled. Harry's never been on stage. Backstimple, this is my goal to make that happen and bring more help with the package. So, I'm going to bring Harry for a ride for us. Okay, so meal number, we're at meal number four now. Post work out. Just hit a back, rear down by step session. Now this is free engine 25 grams, but unfortunately it doesn't fit into one bowl. So we're going to have to split it into two. Not bad problem to have to be honest when you're in cereal. Normally I've cocoa pops, but we're in America, so we've gone for a captain quantity. Gonna enjoy it. Okay, so meal number five, five minutes go. I'll just put down a serving of H2L, remove a little extra bit of water. Then we've got 175 grams of dryweight, jasmine rice. 125 grams of chicken, and again some chopped green beans. And then in the oven at the minute, we've got a nice big thick blue rebago of 40 grams of jam on that. This is meal number five. We're going to total about 1600 grams of carbs a day. 10 liters of water. And then we're going to assess the look, do some posing in the bed as well. The meal number six of seven. Yeah, I feel it's a 101 year. So we are now one more meal away from the final meal. So this is a repeat of the last meal. 175 grams of jasmine rice. 125 grams of chicken, again green beans. As always, and then we've got a nice blue rebago back in the oven with 40 grams of jam. So put this down and then we're on to our last meal of the day, which will be in about an hour or two time. Which is probably my favourite, which is the creamer rice, a little bit of honey, and some raspberries, a little bit of weight as well. So yeah, getting the close to the 1600 grams of carbs now, we need either. So, veg got way isolate inside here. Just for travel purposes, they didn't want to bring a whole tub away. So put it in a nice little electrolyte tub. 25 grams of that. Mix them with a creamer rice cookie dough. So they get the perfect consistency. This is cooked creamer rice almost, so it's a little bit too dry. And then, once you put the isolate in, soft ones up a little bit. It was an if you're just having creamer rice on your own. You just want to get the consistency perfect, and then leave it like that. But like I said, if you over cook it just a tad, then get the isolate in there, and it makes it all nice and smooth on a set. Perfect consistency. And two that. We're going to add 20 grams of almond butter, 40 grams of honey, and 200 grams of raspberries. Last meal, we've got 135 grams of creamer rice, 25 grams of isolate, and then we'll let you light tub. 20 grams of almond butter, marshes have it in last minute, just slow down a little bit. 40 grams of honey, and then 200 grams of raspberries. But you need to weigh them. They won, done. We're in a very, very good position. Harry's fed. He's watered. 600 grams of carbs are going in tenderly, as just over ten years of water, a couple of black coffees. We're starting to see some fullness pulling to a specific, which is good. Let me have some good water health through the day, and with the amount of carbs that you can consume, it's natural for me, it's not about being bone dry at this point. Okay, we've got three days of, another two days, and then it's showday. So it's just trying to get Harry that momentum of bringing the fullness, and then we can start by as an off-mustop, and off the water. It's a good luck for the evening. It's going to get some sleep poofy, so sleep very well last night. I don't know. We've tried a whole afternoon. Get a good night's sleep in, it'll wake up drier, and then I'll set them all in. The Saturday planned the load. It will be another big day, whether it'll be 1600. It'll be, or it'll be close, but we'll pretty much go meal to meal at that point from tomorrow. Today was like the front load of the back load, the front load of the back load. Where we sort of pulled down through, especially with the fly. Just using the 100 grams of carbs yesterday. Today we start the load, and it's just about, then just seeing how that went, trying to throw us across into morning's, looking comparison to days, morning look, and then don't want me to do. We're filled with water tomorrow, and it's a limitation. We'll see. I'm going to go to sleep in a minute. I've got one client planned to do. I'll get some zests.

Real bad. No, it's not. But you hear what I'm saying. Day two in the Big Burma House. It is Friday. Two days prior to showday. Harry is walking up just 1.3 kilos heavier today. After 1600 grams of carbs, ten plus litres of water yesterday. Dry, fuller. Then yesterday's low, which is good start for us. Yesterday was almost like the front load of the back load. Just said yesterday. Just get what we can in showing the GI is clear and good and everything feels good. But in every position today, where he's hungry again for food and I can keep pushing hard because the hurry needs that. This was because he's not the biggest of guys, but aesthetically he's got such a pleasing shape with nice lines, conditions crazy. If we can bring that fullness with that, it's a very good package. He is just wanted off through the get-o to find a shop to get some more rice in my bar. Hopefully he makes it back. Just play her through checking the moment. It's 9 o'clock just gone in the morning, been up since 4 jalanx. Fucker. We're going to get one more meal in Harry before them in Powerhouse gym. Powerhouse gym, yes, it was crazy. I can't express if it ever in America around Detroit, get to the original. There's like three or four here in Detroit. But the original one, we went crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy. So excited to go about that. Push that shen for Harry. He's very strong from the rear. So we pushed through poor yesterday and then we're going to do push today and just try and hold some volume in that up a top line shelf for his. And just see where the look is. So we're just going to plant meal by meal. But two meals deep now, we'll see where we are. Post, work out and then I'll plant the next couple of meals for that. And then it's just a matter of just chilling, posing, chilling, posing, assessing and making the changes where needed. So very excited for that. And we'll catch a little bit. They too, the powerhouse gym we're here. What is probably one of the best gyms. I've trained up, push for Harry, his last workout. So I'm going to move some blood around. Put the 600 grams of carbs that you had yesterday and approximately 600 that you had this morning. Just to good you start moving it around, moving it to where it needs to be. See where we are, post, work out and then assess. Plum the next, one or two meals, post, work out. See where we are from there. See the look. It's looking a bit crazy this morning. It's dry and harder for that. And again, it's going to look a little bit different here in the natural light. When we wake up, it's like four, five o'clock in the morning pitch black. In the darkest place that we're living. So we'll have a look in a bit. See where it is. And we'll give them an eye on some type, mind is mumbling. Just working our way through that was fast. Just to get a blood moving, get a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a freeze of joint. Harry, once you're trying to maximize all the fullness in his chest and in the end of the workout, just so we can see how that translates when we take a look. That was fast. Quite a bit of volume free chest. And then it's just a little, maybe one or two exercises on try to set your stuff to fill them up and then have a look. It's good. Frick it all in there today. Yeah, he's just cranking around. And then you go there so weasc nh Anth a little bit. Let's just do it like a little bit more now. Here we go. Ah, but you see the fact that we have a clothe, but a clothe. you Let me go outside. Nak problema Yeah, Holy Just a little bit more. Give me a clap. Okay. Nice. Nice mate. Much better today. Try those knees out just a little bit. That's it. Good bro. A hamstring belly as well. Furnace in it. Nice. Back a little bit lean back. I'll sit perfect. Sick bro. It's nasty. I'm going to go to the next one. Just done four five rounds of Harry. And the lip is coming alive, coming alive. Really happy with where we are. It's going to be a plan. Don't need to worry. Don't need to panic. Just carry on loading as we are. Keep getting the water in as we are. Everything's falling into place quite comfortably. It's just about just time. It's just taking me a while. I'm here to see where we are. The minute everything is going to plan. So I'm going to go back. Harry's going to eat probably a box of cereal. And I'm going to chill. I'm jet lagged off. It's pretty much the end of the day now. Harry is just going through some rounds. The light in here is horrendous. You're going to get loads in the bathroom. So we're just running through some rounds now to see how everything pops through. and through some rounds now to see how everything pulled through. We'll walk into in a backfree and take a look at the light and just see where we are. Drivers, they were so good. That's it, that's it, perfect. And from that, it's just making the shooting on a couple of things before we go bed with the direction we go with things. So it's looking very positive right now. Considering we're pretty much two full days alone in touch and pretty much. 15, 16,000 calories, well over 3,000 grams of carbs. It's a full midsection which is to be explained at this point. You know, it's not an issue because tomorrow we're going to back off a little bit, clear some GIS base. Dry out even more so just the volume of calories. It's what we're doing. That's for the amount of water, water, water to stick to the body essentially, will be less. So it's an input in there. It's going to be a lot easier. But you're seeing it's physique is a lot full of now. Just good. The response is there. I can see and it's going to give it a live originally, you're caught. It's a very positive place to get right now. So one more meal to go in. Cream and rice, one of Paris' favorites. Yeah. I don't feel right. Two fabulous probably what we'll have just showed you more. It's an only show in the nine o'clock shown. The world will be five, five six o'clock. Get in here then. And then just let it set up in clear for stage. And then finals are not so seven o'clock in the seven p.m. in the universe. It's a long period of time which will manage throughout the day. So let's be sweet then but for now, all my rough harrys looking at Mira and then the Saturday. Good morning. Day three in Detroit. And Harry has woken up in a very very good position. Harry is currently shaving himself. The frosty warm blade. It's where the spillage should sponsor bodybuilders. I think everybody nowadays literally uses a warm blade. It is a god scent. I think I've tasked him to shave his back. But we've woken up on the money today. Just what like couldn't have asked for a bad position because we consumed a lot of food in two days. When you're a bodybuilder, you always have that sort of feeling that you want that flat stomach. You want the few empty and with the amount of food that we put in. Right. The only thing that was thrown today would be woken up a little bit moment but we are four out of the paint page through the stomach. Where two kilos up from yesterday's weight was a very good indication to withdraw and we can see that two kilos in full nurse which is perfect. And it's going to stick. Today is about pulling back the volume. Okay both with food and fluid. Keeping sodium levels high. Just allowing the geodic clear of such. The bodies follow glycogen, you know, glycogen isn't simply like that. So you have to position where you respect that. You know, Harry's not going to be doing a lot of movement today. Yes, he's done a lot of steps. So that with the 2K game there's a very good bonus. Today is a matter of just sitting still with your mother or chill in because I go get his beer trim, head shaved and that is it. We've got registration at three. No sorry. First time. First time at three. It's the one and a half certain. The second one and a half seven which is around about half weeks' meat time. Both days are a big good day. We're catching a bit. That's the other leaves. So this is the game that's coming. I've seen that 5, I've been searching on the walking bit. This last thing I've been wondering about like... Now a film that herself, I've been looking at beer yikes, the Donna's fashion that if I could attend the Muscoor dog, maybe it was not that difficult, but it wasn't as difficult but we had to accept any help. So it was worth any deal. Yeah, we have been there for a long time. Even if we could be because we were in the�, we were so close to an actual place, then we were scared. It was not something that could happen to the grand end. But obviously, this is a certain number of people that we've asked for, and it's quite a lot of people. You didn't have to worry about seeing this. It was often. It was just one. It was just one. It was just one. Yeah. Okay. It's coming. Nice. Nice. Nice. It's a bit flat. Yeah. That's impressive. There you go. Hey guys, we are here at the Double Tree. Okay, this is the post-to-thout where Hammond's being held. After he's been held, the venue isn't too far from here. Harry's just having his first coat done. He was white as me, if not white. So he'll make sure they're doing that very good. That really was just a top coat done. Essentially, it's just a matter of just weighing around down until later on he's got another top-up of his base. 7.5 I think, which is possibly about the time man after he's met. So, right so I'm going to say, we're already literally at 15 minutes walk from here. So, some of his outs, that's being able to walk and not get a few wet things that are treated as good. I'm just doing some work for all sorts of Harry, hungry, tired, and he's just eating some food. He's just eating some meat. So, he's getting, Harry's looking at the developing throughout the day, which is good because he's got four of what he's got. He'll be on the stage nine o'clock tomorrow morning. He'll be getting dry, holding for almost most of the day. He's good. Everything's going to be on the ground, so I think it's a little bit more. When you're quiet. Ah, it's broke. I'm very happy I just announced it on. What a good place. That's why I can get a class. It's fine. Yeah, I'll just go ahead and do that. No, listen, we expect that really good turnout. Thank you guys for coming. We've done our best to make it special for you guys. Obviously, the reason is the prize money. I'm not sure if you guys saw it. We have the best pose or award. Most muscular award and a most shredded award. So, hopefully somebody can win something. We have something for everybody. We were really good venue. We were really good team backstage. So, help you guys out. I won't be long. You guys have all been here before. I just want to say thank you from all of us. We've been in Paul. Recoming means a lot to have the first Detroit show and have you guys show up and make it exciting. So, I appreciate you guys coming. Paul is ready. He tells you on touch on. You know, really just show time tomorrow. We anticipate pros going on stage. We'll type around 11. So try to get to for 9. 3 more. Evening. We're anticipating about a 7. We're roughly 15. So, what we want to do is show starts at 9. We're going to run the men's NPC classes first. By the time they get rolling in the show is going to be 9.15 9.30. We figured they'll be able to be able to now. So, we're hoping to do the intermission around 10.30. After an admission, you guys will come up. So, you guys will be on. Hopefully, we're going to try to set it for 11. So, that you guys know exactly when you're going on. And then at night, same thing, the show starts at 5. By the time it gets rolling, it might be 5.30. An hour on stage. Intermission. Then hopefully, you guys will be on it. 7 o'clock. So, you guys have pretty set time. So, if the show is running in an odd way, we'll just stop it. So, you guys know you're on it. 11 and 7, and that's going to be your time. So, try to make sure you're here and tan to glaze. And all that good stuff. Okay. I don't really have much else to say. Ben, all. We'll leave it to Tyler then. But my disguise is only 60. So, be ready to pose a lot. We'll be giving home a show. So, I'll pose you guys probably a couple of times through. Make sure you guys are good. We'll probably do one last. One last pose down to just to get the crowd some energy and some stuff. So, that's it. Good luck with the four to see how you guys do tomorrow. Okay, guys. Thank you very much for coming. Any questions? Just a grab or what to call them? Or yeah. I'm going to try to do try. But it's a happy celebration. Um, after he's meet the second base coat, Um, Baragas. Orders. Uber, or they're heading back to the house. And we're going to chill tonight. Just had another very quick look at Harry. Um, but, yes. We'll get crazy and crazy by literally the every ten minutes and seem changing. And it's really, really good. It's really good. It's really good. So, we need to manipulate. Um, we're going to fill out quite a heavy and last meal. And now we're going to be over for, we're going to be nine o'clock. Um, we're now going to be on another level of clock, which potentially will be even better for us. All our that geitically, if fully from the heavy meal that we're going to have tonight. And then literally just top up. First of all, we want to remember good for here as we can on a way. Sure. We're going to come back and help you with Baragas. So, Baragas, huh? Harry's in a fantastic position. Harry's hungry. Harry would eat this more. More. Even more. Thanks for. Yep. Um, just to bowl in my food. I think it's getting, it's going to help them then. Just because we've taken back got a little bit today. Just after the, three thousand two hundred grand a car, we put in. We're going to have a thousand, what we did today. Um, this will then carry through nice seats tomorrow. It's a transphastosolium. Yeah, it's going to be a good, a good, a carries control. Feeling good in it. Going great, right, man. Yeah. And this is just going to look even better. Hahaha. Yeah, it's just going to be a very, very good. Yeah, it's very, very good. It's nothing wasted. Yeah. It is just gone six a.m. Uh, myself and Harry have been up since about half four. Um, just getting me a one down. Harry's book, Troy is a bone. Um, we've made well last last night. It's sat and mackily on the stomach for him. Um, no issues. My bowel movements, perfect. Place to be in right now. Best local ever seen him ever. Um, just in the, in the bathroom mirror, as you can see, we're in darkness. We have literally no, like, no lighting in this place, part of the kitchen in the bathroom. Um, but it's all gone to plan just a, um, the sort of, you know, we are touching for me or one, which will be the only me that we touch in very hundred calories, 200 pounds of carbs, that we've understood. And it's, it's foury plus proving, but all the traits proving pretty much just there. Because that very small scybos I slept to me makes him an a call. Um, she's got a couple of pot types. Um, there's been it, the American stuff. But it's freezing, you've done all through this load. The load is now totaled. I think that's what's on me, I remember. A load has totaled with this meal over, uh, was it 28,000? How are you? 20. Yeah, it's probably over 28,000 calories. Um, with such in, uh, or nearly four and a half, a thousand, a thousand, a thousand, four thousand, five hundred, yeah, four thousand, five hundred, yeah. Four thousand, five hundred grams of carbs. Um, it's incredible just to see it, and think well, the hell has that gone, you know. Um, dropped three kilos over night. And that was from, well, 10 p.m. to, like, five a.m. So, it's a good side thing to move forward. Um, I'm laughing. I'm tired. Still, um, I think that catches up with just about as time we get back to the UK. And then we have to read just again. Um, but all is geared. Um, just with the fly free some check-ins. Um, then, time is at, uh, or probably, time, hurry. Uh, what do you, eh? Good, wait. So, I have to do the venue. And then just chill there. Show time is 11, which is even better. We thought it was 9, but it's 11, show starts at 9. Uh, so I said that, then the metal holder, I want you to show the rolling, they're going to literally pull it, and then the pros will be on bail on 11, which is good to know. So, we can time everything perfectly. This is going to sit nicely. Um, we won't really need to do a lot from here. Yeah, and this game time, we'll see we'll catch it out. Let's go in the way. This is a money shop. Then we'll see the engremly thing to do with yours. You've got... Yeah, but that's all we offer now. Yeah, but that's all. Yeah, I got some bonus spots. That feels full ofiously kind of lonely but it doesn't hit me. Oh, that's what it's called. Oh, that's what it's called. Back at the hotel, Harry is getting his final coat of his top coat then. Luckily, we spoke the vent because we were on our way to the venue. The venue, they're actually still doing the tanniff here at the hotel. So we're here quickly. Just had a quick look at Harry after he's had his tan. Sure, he's good. Then he had to the venue. And then she just lay him horizontal because everything now We've done just a mile of this waiting time. It's of a nice sense. But very excited. It's not a big show. I'm sorry, six guys in it. Two, six are very good guys. So it's going to be interesting to see. How things go. It's going to be a great production. The stage is amazing. Black by a truck. Great lighting. And Filespot on three extra awards. So he's got the most muscular most shredded and best pose there. So we're coming for that most shredded one. We're catching up. So we're going to do this one. That's it. Got me. Got me. On. Literally, we need now the good shot, those of us. We'll probably do like 500 mil. So put the prep on him several minutes. Get that in. It's been like 10, 15 minutes window. So we're running. You have it. Yeah, I'm happy about that man. I just had to put it on. Yeah. We're in that. Yeah. Yeah. We're going to be on the road. We should have been on that road. We're going to be on the road. We're going to be on the road. Yeah. How? Yes. Can you show these gentlemen where dressing room A is? Yes. Three whole things are there. For a post? Yeah. Yeah. I'm one of these. I'm so here. That one's coming. Yeah. That money. I'm going to see. Okay. Ready? Yeah. Yeah. We just gave it on the road. Yeah.

Thank you. Okay. Good. Good. One, seventy, one, seventy, one, switch, please. One, seventy, and one, seventy, three, switch, please. Let's go, boy. Guys, spread out a little. Come on. Take it.

Good, run, run, hold the glutes. Back, couple by, sir. Go, pardon me. Back, last breath. One, one, two, three, switch, please. One, one, two, three, switch, please. There you go. So, in tradition, we're eating more burgers. Haraj is just going to stage from pre-judging the absolute incredible. I don't think the peak had gone any better. It was good to see it in the light. On that stage, probably the best way I've ever seen a bodybuilding show. I've been to a lot of other videos. It's a fair play to follow. I've put one out of a show on yourself. This is just a top hurry up. Final is going to be, set on time now. Number six of our followers, the final. Big influx of food now. We know this works really well for Haraj. It's not just not everyone has this. We just know that it works. Get it in, enjoy it. Go back to the apartment and just chill. Let it do it with some magic. And then, get a bit of fluid in. Go for that. Hey guys, we're back. We're back at the venue. Haraj is just getting his hand touched up. We are half an hour from stage. Haraj is well rested. I've got a good amount of food in. He's a little bit sharper. Just trying to bring his best again. Holding that look. We had. We've had a good seven hours to hold it. So all on point, very, very happy. Just about enjoying this now. It's going to be a fantastic production. It's exciting to see good athletes on stage. But I'm going to now give you a more in vocalic intense. It's very good to be wearing clothes or things. I think the luck at the finals when he's guys is going to decide who's going to win it. So we'll see. Back a little by seven. Back, last breath. Side try set. Up dov风 dibe. Your favourب was muscular. And we've won Scali115 Arcudsman deserved this wheal. All of the venue on step-out. So, some very close friends of ours passed in the last few years. We have a separate million John Meadows and Luke Sandow. And we want you to be fitting that our first show together, we honor them in their memory and I think it's something we're going to continue to do before just to always have them in our thoughts. So, we have three prizes. We have most shredded, most muscular and best-full. One, 75, Justin Luis Rodriguez. In third place, the spring at two, number 173, Ronald Gordon. Let's bring that to Vitali Goodby-Jell. That is Job done in Detroit. Harry, unfortunately they're made to five. Condition, fullness was all there. We knew the school going into this. It's just a matter of attitude to his very pleas and frame. When that happens, it's going to be something to watch out for. It's just time, you know, it's just time spent in the gym. Time spent out away from the state. But we have more show left in us. So, that'll be in the York. That'll be probably in a few YouTube's time.

Yes guys, episode one of this year's YouTube vlog. Okay so we've never done this before but what we want to do this year is try and capture every single show. Show you guys a little bit of an insight at what we're doing. Okay today we are a day out from the first regional and two-row show. Okay we've got four guys. We've got two millioners. It was just nailed about 200 grams of carbs. Jim, see the overweight, Ryan Mackin, see the overweight and I got a classic guy Joe, who's 500 grams under his weight cap with three hours to go. So we're just holding him in there when we're really currently just under the cup like heavies. But everybody is on point they're looking like spa. So it's just my way of just getting to registration, getting the tanned and assessing that look and then putting together the final meals for a day for the guys. I've got my teeth in there. The teeth in. I've been trying to carve up with like 1500 grams of carbs with no front teeth. Yeah, you guess? Yes. So we are here back at Braewake. We're seeing the start. Guys have just gone into get tanned. Everybody is looking good. Registration is going to be in. We are looking. So our our so registration is going to start. Joe, my classic guy is 99.9 with his clothes on. He's got to be 99.8. Jordan is the same. He's on the cuff of like everyone heavy weight. We want to go into like heavy. So we're just making sure that food is not going in at the moment. Just so we can stay in to the same that like heavy category. It's going to be good. So kind of like the series guys after their tanned and then go from there. So Joe is classy classic. We're just going to find out what it's height is. So it's a much as weight. I'm just making sure he's under the cap. If you should be. We were sitting just at the cap we closed on. So by now we should be well in there. Once we get the green light we can then fill the rig. That the fun begins. Yeah. We're going to. Let's go. Joe is in. Let's go. Everybody has registered. Joe made weight. Easy gym weight in a hundred and twenty-two kilos. Ryan weight in a 120. Jordan just made light heavies. But yeah everybody's good to go. We go back. We're pretty screwed up. And then plumb the rest of the light into the morning. It's game time. Yeah guys it's showday. Okay. Time has come. First showday season. Everybody is on point. Everybody's had the second coat of tanned. Jordan is now sucking into some more. We're going to go in. Okay. It's seen everybody this morning. I think that any sleep. Late night just makes your elbows good. I've got five of the hot spot in. First check in with everybody. And then just going to feel like food. So the sodium. Just put everybody in a nice prime position. Where they go into the show. So it's just literally plain sailing from here. It's a good time. Yes. So, what have you been doing? I'm to class it now with one more guide Jo. And then we can go in. Job done. So, first show the season finish. We have now seen everybody. Jo's just come on stage. There it in. Class D for class it. The best package we've brought together. So it's exciting to see what we can do from here. You're going to have a conversation tomorrow. Depending on where we do is you get into each time. That's it for today. See you next time. Thank you.

Just how would wait nicely he's sitting just below the cap for light heavies, which is carried we obviously want to go in, to see one three weeks ago so every little point we are starting about kilo of toy to them where we were for the regional so everything's fulfilling to play nicely and let's see what happens tomorrow. Same to say – Chenglen being hype and we pay very much thank you so much. So this is probably my first actual decent meal I've had in the last 48 hours. There is now quarter eight during this register during this time meal six will be going down very soon. I don't know if you can see this. And he will be harder in 12 pancakes. I'll probably go to the point, ground to the 30 grams of almond but I'll one banana. I'll give it a squeeze. So roughly 125 grams of carbs, just below 20 grams of fup, a small amount of peri. And we just hate this totem. Today, to 915 grams of carbs and a hundred grams of fups, I'm very don't know, peri. So the plan was just pre-mushed just popping up to the brim, dry them out overnight. In the morning, he will find off. We'll be up about 45 o'clock. We'll take a good look. It won't be some meal in probably around about half five six-ish. And then there will be a general meal probably just like rice cakes, almond but up there, jam. Probably two hours before stage. And then it's just a moment of just rung into the show. No G.I.S. rest, no full-use uncomfortable process of trying to get rid of anything. It's so clear, we'll get the dough from the end hand. And then not bad. See in the morning. You're on me. You're on. Trust me. I'll be fine. You're on me. You're on. Trust me. Hold on to five. What? What? Four. Three. Two. And what? So the show today is called to five. We're just about to go and make dinner. See what he looks like and then plan from there. So show started nine o'clock. Just three hours away. He should be on the end of four hours, or again. So plan first meal. And then see where he says. Go get time. Go from there. Go ahead. You did? No way. Shh. That's great. That's all me. It's all. You did for my slideshow, man. Thank you. Shh. You're so beautiful. Yeah. There's no reason. I'm so sorry. Hey. Oh. Hey. Go. Wisconsin. Nice shot. Come. Come. Figure out. Be right back. This is actually going. Hey.

the but So we've just landed in Kloan, headed to the apartment, we can't get into a cool past team. So first stop hit this gym, it's fucking epic, a well-own gym, there was no music but it's full of hoist stuff which is incredible, brand new kit, crazy crazy good gym. Last session with Jordan, just moved some blood around and then climbed the last three meals and we're good together. and some guys right three soccer gym Victor Hey I'm going to go. Yeah, I'm going to go. I'm going to have a few miles to go. Should I go to the next one? I'm going to go. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I got a bath. Sorry. I'm just going to do it. Yeah, yes it's nice. I'm going to bring that dog. AungAtab. Well, please, I can help a little bit. I'm like- They won in Germany, nearly complete. We got the plane, we headed to the Airbnb, drove the baggage off, went to the gym, Crack in gym, world gym, for the hoist stuff, which was epic. Went to Liddles, smashing peanut butter on the floor, and we got back, five of Jordan Denhovers, Kitchell's Skales rim, so we can wait and hear this. We just figured out, so we had an iPhone on the mission to find some Skales. Fels of Skales, but then to the strat, there's my close shot bit. I did buy for the mantis, I think I'd found a little bit. What made me laugh to Jordan this evening? We have a gun as a breast of us, we've done in the past, with this load. What we're trying to achieve is real crystalline us, and we're feeling that from both shows, has given us enough data to basically put this final look together, which in my opinion is going to be the best look. So, that is obviously a new attempt in fantastic at the moment. I am actually wiped out of the net once I won the AN, and I still have seven check-ins left to do, and then I've hit the sack, ready to come to run. I'm just one of my normal first known interest rates, getting my team outside. I just rose, please, put it back. Let it not even over, it's on you for the time. Just trickle me, and as you know, with the war, I'm just going to get a little further in. I was at a pretty pre-procal our preparations going on. Well, we are giving it all. Come on, it's raining more. The best look is coming. The war holds kind of work. Don't worry, it's just peat max before I go for it. I'm not sure if I can finish it. I'm not sure if I can finish it. Thank you, Jeremy. Good afternoon. I'm Steve O. I'm Jordan. It's a very nice time. First time we're going to take this pizza. I'm going to show you the real amount of pizza. I'm a bit... It's a bit as far as I can see. It's not because I'm so happy. I'm just going to go to the street for dinner. I'm not going to show you the full of what it is. It's going to get nice and weight. Probably that's of the gym. You know, I'm going to set your name. Jordan obviously, too. Well, good luck. It's a good luck. And we have the town hall. It's a good assessment of all the rest of the people. We're going to have a town hall today. We are at 2 meals a week. So everything is going to go well. We got a lot of the time. We're going to do it for the next 24 hours. It's more of a day when it's going to take weeks with meals. Just making sure everything is going to go well. It's just taking a while. Yeah. Yeah. No. No. Yeah. No. No. No. You mean? Oh, the way is going to make it. It's good. Well, you make this. Yeah. You want to say, because Jordan means you have to have a good time. But the Jordan is this, but you project my means. This. You're going to get in the air. You got my ideas for all of the life. Don't make this. Never told me. Don't make this. Don't make this. It's going. It's going. It's going. I'm going. I'm going. Go out. Go out. Go out. Go out. Go out. Never. Never. Please. It's crazy. That's it. I've got it. I've got it. I've got it. I've got it. That's it. You got it. And I'm far out. That's it. You're going. You need more. Yeah. Don't make it. Yeah, because I'm on the ground. So fine. Fine. Fine. I was in the savi. All lapsed. See, you can get. They're not so good. One. See for. Left arm and should snap the plan Kane Suzy High Street. Oh, this is something. Nothing? It's nothing. Oh, you did not forward to you. Oh, yes, very true. So we are back at the apartment. Jordan is ready to say that he's now a child. That was one month for a disaster. Oh, Doug, we're just announcing that. We're sitting back, chill. Still, the net is okay. I'm not mad. I'd be like, how'd you say about the carps? I'm feeling a warm and good to go in. I've been in my firmness. So this is the good luck to be top. I'm just tricky to fluid it. I forgot the rest of the night. With a table of meals, a bandath of love. And then just a little bit over waking up on the money. So pretty much under that. Two kilos down, though I have the approach I'm going to discover is different for the last team, like I said before. It's just a gallery they cut out and assess each. Four inches, says, what we're doing as well. So just to my, I've just put them together. And hopefully this plush is just going to be either one. I'm just like, huh? I'm just like, huh? I'm just like, huh? I'm just like, huh? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. embarrassed about just being like 5 people, he has to have a face. It's not really beautiful. That's like walking all the inches, now. How fluffy he is. Yeah. Yep. You got that? Yeah, I think just got the turn from the gym. The weather would be really beautiful. Let me show you something from front. It is now 5 in 500. Just gotta get me that suited it, so. we're getting dry yeah very excited isn't it under the state but so this meal warm meal to planned out and tomorrow morning is gonna be a very very scary yeah try to hold my sympathetic You just... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Just make you listen to that fool, and then I was, you know, everything that you've been in fact alive. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I'm going to have to listen to it, mate. You have never done that. Sure. They too, then we are looking very, very sharp. Okay, this is Jordan's Bastard Pabber. Avaluag. I've going to bed for the moment before the show. So all we can do now is go to bed. Our sales may not have to be enough to stand in, and I'll be doing card works at this. It's just a matter of waking up in the morning. Jordan's going to be on the Monday. I'm going to be happy, and then it's just a game time. So should be, we're starting around half a ten. There's no fitness, let us class the body around in. And it's open body building. So I say we're over half as a level, top as ten new game time. You should be odd. And it's just, we're going to see what happens. Go get feeling about this one.

— Let's go! We're launching Mayday. It's so day we are still ready to rock. We're waiting for a new year to get to the venue, get tired, and then for like a month's age. And the look at Jordan 5, got the small in. It was very much on the money, very, very happy. One meal in 150g of carbs, better fats. It was tiny bit of protein, scoring that fluid. Good Italian, public Italian, at the end of the town, basically. Just tweaked a few things if we need to, just if there are a few roasts, take it in, roast with a square of ice. And then it's just a bit of waiting to show that. We're here at the venue, Jordan has just been turned. We've had a quick look. Things are looking very, very good. I'm very excited. I'm trying to just keep everything cool. The look is very strange. The look is very strange. I'm trying to keep everything cool. The look is very strange. I'm trying to keep everything cool. The look is very strange. It's very, very good. For me, we weren't even going to do this show. We have to the venue, we're going to call it a day. A few days later, we called some more off with a set. We looked at how Jordan was responding. He was in a good position to say. So we just know straight into it. And it's been a good move. It's been a good move. It's been a good move. We've got probably about two or three hours until stage time. So tomorrow I'm chilling now. I'll try to get some cards in a bit of a little bit of sodium. Just see what they're packing us in the day. I am now in a rainbow. Now I'm in a skull of a cat. I'm going to be in a blue sky. I can be in a blue sky. I can be in a blue sky. I can be in a blue sky. There's a crane. Looking up all the same. Let me walk. Let me walk. Let me walk. There's a plane. It's just a small plane. It's just a small plane. It's just a small plane. I can't be in a blue sky. I can't be in a blue sky. I can't be in a blue sky. I can't be in a blue sky. I can't be in a blue sky. I can't be in a blue sky. I can't be in a blue sky. I can't be in a blue sky. I can't be in a blue sky. I can't be in a blue sky. I can't be in a blue sky. I can't be in a blue sky. I can't be in a blue sky. I can't be in a blue sky. I can't be in a blue sky.

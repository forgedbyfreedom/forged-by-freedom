Just had a quick look at it again. We woke up at four o'clock. See where I think sitting after going about about 11 hitting the final meal. Things were looking really good then. Once you were at four o'clock, got a meal in at that point. Because of that time period that we've had to fill Abby. I've had to be on it to try and make sure that we don't lose that fullness now. So that meal at four of those crucial. Just put another meal in now. Just about workout with the math rules, but it will be pretty much just rice cakes jam. No, but it's probably some fruit loafs like that. I get to go my cards in. Head to the venue. Get tanned. And then it should be on around about 11. Hopefully it will go to the point.

In Sweden, there was twenty four in the long class. So, ten, four, five, half-leaven. I reckon, but John and Levin faced twelve, yeah. And what was the white class? Just something I could just let him do. I'm looking for us. So, Abby is now backstage. Okay. We are ready to rock. He is on the money. Okay, it's best he's ever looked. He's so happy, confident.

We'll come back here for five o'clock. We're going to go supermarket back to the house. We're going to run into the finals. Hopefully. Push on that broguide. Back in the UK, I've got Nick doing mental zik in the... I'm taking classic. He's looking for the same. He just getting his tanneder now. I'm going to get a bit of a little process. He should be on stage for the pro-membersyke around about half-bours. So, managing that. And I've got Louie Davis who was about 24 hours. Less than 24 hours out of Nell from YouTube, who was reaching the local Mr. J.T. Which we will try into a 10 Sunday when we land back in the UK. We land about half-9, quarter-10. And then we got a fly to... Maybe a stick in the ceiling. I'm nervous. I've put a stick here. So, I can go with the fuck. I was looking right. What? I'm going to do that for some of my videos. I'm going to lie. I'm talking. I'm talking. I'm talking. I'm going to be on the top. I'm going to be on the top. I'm going to be on the top. Nick, we're on the top. I don't know how it's been. I'm going to be on the top. I can make sure you guys check in. Ow! Fuck! Fuck! Get in there. I look fucking crazy. Happy. You have it. Yes. When you hit that red double, you have to make sure your hamstrings are in the top of the ceiling. Make sure you don't mess with the difference. We are on. We. I can't even act. Close. I'm sure you don't mess with us. I... I... No. This is crazy. You better. You're going to be better? Yeah. I'm going to move forward. Woo! I'm going to shut down. I'm not. I'm going to move forward. Yeah. Okay. I'll probably do just a little bit of rice cakes in jam and nothing crazy. Yeah. Yeah. You're on. You're on. You're on. You're on. You're on. You're on. You're back. Uh, concert all year round three. My man is just going for a little piss. He's going for a little harder. And the more put the title we did. The three judges. We headed back to the hotel. Look at that. I have been beaten. Put this man to bed. I have a no stop. I'm going to walk on the joy of full on. I don't want to walk. Keep him a muffin. Never a food. Man's happy. He's asking looking back to again though. Three three three judges. We left St. Louis stage. We want to keep that low. It's not about going away in just destroying it with burger or fries. for a ride somewhere. It's about maintaining that bringin' it presentation for the finals and making sure that we're gonna hopefully take that first place to hit the overall I think there's enough pro-killer. So it's been good to put experience and what we've done. We've got the exact same thing. You know, it's very important to give up the individual same thing, to throughout the whole prep. Don't start introducing new run-up things last minute. It's the last thing we want to do is for what the look. You know, your body's already used to process the same type of food. So I'm very important that we do the stuff that we've got the same shop. We're seeing what we've got. We're seeing everything. You know what I mean? So we're gonna keep that in sister's, so I flew, who? Game time. News in. Nick has just taken first place, or a complex classic. Man's a Z. So he is now going on to the overall, which should be about that many minutes time. So another good result for the day. Fingers crossed. We've taken overall there. We get the pro-killer here. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. For rough out some. For ya know folks, they start batting my bones. Wellient prints, by our own burning looks. I don't know if all three minutes left. Everybody wants me home. All raw! With we each stand somewhere, we can wear me blue, even those grey shadows and winning Yes Baby! How old! Kemmaxes! Classic käyttense. Run, Run, Run, recovery successist offJonas violin four people there ... five 7 in I learned done. Okay, so I really love that amazing took his class, class D, one point into the overall Unfortunately, over a birthday, we done our best, he looked absolutely insane, but class D guy was very very good. But please don't be afraid, I'm not sure he's shredded, a lot tissue, but yeah, no broguards Dave, and we don't stop. However, we do have a special guest. Mr Carlos. New, maybe bro. That was a real thrill. It's a thing you might as well, obviously I saw you after the pre-jocing our news, you have said, like, this could be on. And then we come back later. I appreciate you Conmer, and this is a lot of news. I love the British community. It's a good, it's a good body movement. It's a good move. It's what was it? Free weeks ago, four weeks ago. I can't believe it. I think it was three weeks. Re-sport for that. You need to know, you can speak in over there. Yeah, I don't know. I'm sure. But the moment is like, like, it's warm. Yeah, good morning, oh, it is about five. Something morning. Yeah, we just got head to the airport, drop the car off, jump on plane, land this sunset, nail it to maiden head for two roof show. Louis is competing there. He should be on stage probably around about our bus 11. Maybe 11 o'clock. We land at half past nine, so it's going to be very right. I've also got Nick, who won yesterday, and I'm going at the fair expo today. So I'm just going to split the him. I think it's in pictures and videos across the minute. My little job. See how he's looking, and rolling with that one. We'll give Louis his orders in a minute. We're going to give it air for about an hour, so I'm just going to make sure the guys have got their instructions for that period of time. And as soon as I land touch base, it'll go to him. We have just landed in the UK. It is 10 to 10. The two brochure starts in 10 minutes. We are in our 10 minutes away, so we're fucking going. So Louis is in classic, and he passes a few to start at 11. My sat nav just tell me who your maths tell me. His speed won't go in at me. This thing in his past 11 minutes. We will get there. But London traffic can push him on that. So, take a scratch. We're going to make it in time. Yeah. Man, I'm going to make it. I'm going to fucking make it. We'll stop on there. 20 past 11. Oh, absolutely fantastic. Just drive safe, right? I'm not going to put you on stage. I'm going to tell you now. What's the start of the classic, instead of 11 o'clock? Do you know what? I'm not sure. I've just put it here. I think it might be 11, 11, 15. So, I definitely think it would be here, bro. Are they doing guest spot in between body building and club? Yeah. Are they doing body building? Yeah, yeah. That's why they said the classic side I never thought. Bang. Yes. Yes. The traffic starts at 11 o'clock. Yeah, we can. Yeah. All right. See you in a minute. Do you know what I mean? Quick stop. Petrostation. I forgot how much just thing drinks. Fuel. We have 50 miles to go. We're starting miles less than the tank. So, we're still on schedule. The show for classic isn't how I started out. It was 11, because we got guest poses. So, we are on point. We're going to make you a 10 minutes to spare. So, fingers crossed. Yeah. I'm going to start on the end of the line. I'm going to leave. Who wins guys who wins? He's going to use your glasses or not only with the UK, but several I have been in. Let it start. Let it start. Let it start. We're all this brilliant idea. It's fine, kid. I'm going to buy some. You said you won't really go. I'm going to buy some. I'm going to buy some. I'm going to buy some.

We're going to go on to Spain next week. So we have a plan in place. We're going to go get the point. I'll probably have a chance. We're going to go.

It's a little bit insane. Absolutely insane. You did back the back show. So you competed just a one. And then, a long day today, he looked absolutely insane from the pictures I've been saying in the videos. Just one of those things. I haven't seen any pictures yet. So when I do, I'll give him some feedback. It does. I think he can. Let me just give some feedback from some people who live there as well. Go from there. I'm going to have a chat with him. Probably tonight. Tomorrow. And so. So a game plan. For the way forward, whether we could do another show. Soon. Or we'd take a step back and plan something later on. Louis smashed it today. I'll be able to smash it yesterday. Nick smashed it yesterday. Nick got third today. Smash it. Cracking weekend. Absolutely buzzing. Every is killing it. Peace.

Yes guys, we are here at the strength of fitness lab in Wigan, what fantastic gym? Really good guys, really good lighting, really good fitness. I am broken, I have my shoulder last night, so I have kind of trained with my heart so I am going to be going to back the equilibrium and it is not so many insane. I do this at a manor, however, training, and it is a pretty big success. Even now we have got an hour and a quarter now this session before a shot. It is going to hold that workout with a little bit of back, soft up for a manor. You can be throwing a little bit of back for me, this is well. A lot of good lowly stuff here today, so in this gym we must have a good one. What we are doing is spending the most of your maxi, are quick and quite easily. We have to make it difficult to pull the whole move. Only into muscle rounds, rest force set, and even though that is really maximized the alpha, just get what we need to get done. We are going to do a workout, and we are doing a good workout. We are going to do a good workout, and we are going to do a good workout. We have recently changed the disease, trained with split, and that is always pretty much to a pro-smit. I like the sub-roads of me out the gym for repressment, but how much of this can see these deep in the front, and then we have been in a position because we got multiple shows running in. We can try and go in, raise the weight, and multiple muscle breach in session. We can get in, train them as soon as we get out. We have got a lot of work in the LC today, and we are going to say a rotation training split, basically working on whits and thickness in its back, upper left, arms swing white glutes, and this one we are really, really well. We are currently sitting at a 100-footed kilo, that week is out, and we are very, very good. This last day of the week, we are going to want to make one at 7, so we are going to bring something completely different this summer hours, work on the weaker areas, really cool in the month, but really excited to see all we can see when it comes to sunburn at the same week. So recently our team watched my respect, recently I was doing free level at 2 up at, and you also didn't know I am going to throw that in my belly for a bit, work time to get used to doing that on. Now, if my opponents were about to go a little bit, I would like to wrap my eyes in today's split, every 3 push forward nights, and so each mother root in the equal miles, little whack throughout the week, out of the middle of that piece. Is that any favourite nation? I am going to say a few minutes, my favourite bit of watching like, bodybuilding reviews when I was a kid, was watching them shoot, who's shopping? What you can do is watch a J-Cut and watch Render Super. So now we are going to watch, look at this, pick up this food, the next couple of days. The plan is 10 weeks out, the in over 7,000 calories, 1,000 grams of carbs. This is steak. I'm only going to cook 101 meal prep, rats, rice, turkey, turkey, turkey, sticking around here on the ground, go to the food. I found food I'm not allowed, I never come to fucking ask them what I'm on, pack them out. No, I bought these. Put it in a hungry oven. You want? Can I watch a eat them? Yeah. See, balls are cooked. All right, give me a meal, hey, that's a minute, make it. Yeah, I feel it. Yeah, I feel it. Cheeks are stuck in it. What goes, freer you? That's right. Feel it good, feel it just in there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And stop working, I don't know, I'm sorry, I'm gonna take it off. Put it in the place. Put it in the place. Put it in the place. Put it in the place. Put it in the place. Put it in the place. Yeah, that's it. Put it back. It's a bad one, bro. Why do you crack in so much? You go up and go up and go up. So we're going up, go up on your cat, up and then sink into your glutes and hamstrings. So we're going up and go up and go up and go on the cat, relax and then relax your glutes. Okay. Then go up on the tiptoes. Okay. Then sit into your glutes and hamstrings. Really hard. No, no, no. We're going to see you on the floor. Oh, that's a lot of your hooks. Up and then like almost drive your hamstrings into the floor. And the drops. No, no, you're not doing it. You're not doing it. You're not doing it there. Right? We're going to do this. Go up. Take it right here. And then we sit into the hamstrings. Like an ordinary. Like a walk. Normally it's in the lower floor. I don't confuse you. You want it? That one's up. Not relax. Just plant it here a little more. Squeeze it, move to him. Like then I have to show you how that. Yeah, I always let it up. You don't want to go. You don't want to go. Just go away. Yeah. It's the after I've got a few more vegetables. Like 20 minutes for any minutes after I've got my stomach to go. And then I'll be happy. You'll probably be on the other side. I'm going to go in the vegetables. Do you know how many? Yeah. Oh, don't ever root. I don't know if it's different for you. Make them home mid. Don't be like my fat frio. No, okay. Like yeah, I'll get my barbecue chips with them on that. Yeah. Get a wedge with barbecue chips. Well, the actual challenge is that actual veggies. No, that chips. Great. Just going to find out if they tell me I'm a calorie. I'm not. Do you have a single whole pack? I just need to warm. Okay, that's it. Yeah. I'll give you a bit of water. Just a filly. Awesome. Awesome. You need to. Does that mean I don't need? Does that mean I don't need? Does that mean I don't need my cement tonight? Yeah, I've just said that in the morning. I'll never know if it's coming twice. That's my sugar, my mouth. I'll give you water. Go ahead and stick on. I'm like the coach. Give me any water. I'm just going to give my bag. It's probably going to take a guess. Yes, and you're one. Maybe with one. Then it's a little bit of a bit of a bit. Yeah, but just be fine. We're all about how you need to have a firebuck to your sugar market. That sounds like a gastrointour. Drunking to be, or in a, I can even give you, so you can make it yourself. You're just going to be working. It's up to yourself. Well, I'm working. One mile away. Okay. And a cloth. Yeah. And you want to get some sleep for me. So, what do you're burying? Okay. I'll tell you what they got. Oh, God. Just see if there's any smash burges around here. Like, see some burges. Yeah. With three lots of fries. Free lots of large fries. Two large breads. So, of course. If you want to risk having a double out of that trap, put it in. Okay. If you want to. Yeah. Well, like, we'll work for a little cheese. That'd be it. We'll see. She's set you off. I'm trying to make sure that that's true. Maybe. Maybe. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just cheese burick or in a bun. I'm at two parties. Cheese bun. Take all the onions and make some of my thought work. Three large fries. Okay. With that rate. With what I don't know if they're going on. Yeah. I don't know if they're going on.

Make it a hat trick. Some it tells me yes. Jump in and go. There's shank in our seat. Oh my god. Okay. Where is our two? Hahahaha hahahaha. Come on. Take one before the moment. Thank you. Yeah, sure. We only have an option. If you're owned by the CHD of EXPERTS, you're equally smart. I'll do a call from Future- Three days time, in three days time, will we make it three out of three? Will I be going home that I'm a trainer of the champion? Some thinking my heart said yes, however the mind knows this with the mind does. Play out of story in your head of eventualities, but we're locked into the process. It's got to go again the best we've locked. So what will be? Learn to walk by faith and not by sight. I'm getting bit and head to toe in Muzzies. So at one moment my gut is humble about first day in Spain. Seeing Louis at Titans, putting for a quick session, pull session, nothing serious. Just moving the blood around, moving the food around, putting in a position where he can start his load. Effectively, okay, we're under the cap. So we've got a good amount of carbs going into night registration. The him is two o'clock tomorrow. Abbey Ola is getting closer to his cap. He's 105.8 this evening, which is good way for him. His caps, 104.5. That's got to be made by tomorrow morning about 10 o'clock. Probably about 11 o'clock by the time he lands and gets to the venue. We're going to head off early. We'll meet him at the venue. Then go to Titans again. But him for a session. See where we are. Plan the food in because we've actually got an extra day load in this tunnel around rather than when in Ireland. We only have a very short period of time. So it's going to be interesting to see what we can do as he can that time period. Then go back to the apartment, catch up the Louis. Go to Titans with him and then go to the registration and then to Titans with him. See how we can move with him. So it should be a good day tomorrow. Saturday the day of chicken eating and Sunday is show day. Tonight, climb work early night. Up in the morning and get going. Your guys, it's Friday morning. We're here at BV Space's registration day. Just waiting on Abbey. Let's see a ride. You've just got off the plane. You went to bed under the cat. So he's just been sitting on the wall through the plane journey. Make it here. It should make way absolutely fine. And I can feed him. I thought it's actually in your sleep. We'll leave he. I'm not sure if we're in full session. Just move some blood around. Just put me in a position where he can then start his load. As he has done, he's a very important man. I'll be out of his bed. He's coming. I can see the man. He's got a hill. He's got a lot of his. We're in a position now where I need to see this man. Yes, yes, yes. I get some food in and make it. Yeah, listen. I haven't eaten in the while. I was a foot. I was a foot like that. I'm full of energy. This is Johnny. This is my boy. Yeah. He's going to show on us around. And see you. So what's going to be a hell? Just stay up there. We're going to get a way in. And then it's going to be a fucking food. I've been looking forward to this. Even oats. Anything right now. I'll make sure I have all the good stuff. So all of this stuff. Yeah. Thank you. Hey, buddy. You're hungry for some. Hey, you're hungry for some. Hey, you're hungry.

Apple-Moddy fun. All my cigarettes covered. Even now. Okay, just for the boy here great. Just take on the guys. As we continue the process, tomorrow we have full rest day. Okay, so it's the last sleeping in a zoom round of poses. It's like 9 or 7. It's Sunday. They're not going to be able to score a score. It's not going to be a pretty problem. I'm going to try to do it. We've gone down a little bit. So we just have to manipulate everything. So make sure we're at a level for that time frame. It's like you're too old.

I am thinking about something Unknown Alright, stop with your pussy single arm. No weight, like, cool downs, okay? This back, here, was not built. So we're doing this for 15 years, okay? Deadlift in Barbell Rowan, heavy fucking weight. For years, okay? I've now actually taken any deadlift in any bent over row in away from Lewis at the moment. We are now being very selective with the exercises that we are choosing to ensure that we create the physique that we want to see on stage, okay? So what we're doing is trying to work on that upper whip, so we'll be just picking movements that are going to work with his physique, okay? Stop looking at favorite guys on Instagram and copy in the movements there, they're in because they've probably got 10, 15 years experience on you. Start with a basic, start with a groundwork filled up foundation. Hey, hey, hey, hey, go, come on, come on, drive. High, high, high high, high, high, high, high. Help! Catch you on the next.

I'm going to do it. Come on there. Oh. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. If you get the chance to have a use of these, it's a bit of a quick move to use. From a lot of bias. perspective. Try it. Easy. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. No. I. I. I. I. Oh. Oh, fuck you. Come on. I gotta go. Drive. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. Come on, babe. Come on, babe. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Lewis is five weeks out, Amanda's six. Both training with the same intensity. Same strength, all because the team is managed properly. We're able to carry out all of our sessions, 100%. We're not worrying about backing off. Use the lies in Rectown Reserve. We can hit every session still at 100%. And this managing that constantly going into the next few weeks is important. Just to make sure the body is going to be fresh in a position where they can both peak to perfection. Oh, yes. One more exercise with back. It's going to do a little bit of shrugs. We only recently just brought shrugs back into Lewis's plan. Just working a little bit of thickness through the upper back, free the run boys, free the traps. Just to release outline the detail in his physique. So, some of you are working on for the last five, six months. Finish that, come relax, slice them by, and then we're done. You got 15? Yeah. Ow. Ow. I just said no, I don't know how to put them in.

Two large fries. Feed him up. He's looking himself in America. He is so flat at the moment. Funny the meeting all week. But the answer to so many guys out there that were worried that they're feeling flat. They're feeling depleted. They're on prep. You're meant to get back free. You need to get flat. It's not about beautiful. You're going to be lower than the pumps. The pumps will go eventually. It's about going through the motions. Not getting caught up in your head thinking I should be fit in the pump. You need to get that mindset that you're doing all of this for a reason. Just go through the process every single day and you'll get to where you want to be. Work. Work done for the day. You just had a handful of clients checking in Saturdays and Sundays normally.

Yes guys, welcome back to the YouTube we are here at Grittness. Okay it is show we can't is the Europe approach and the MPC European Pro Qualifier. We have a number of athletes from the team from season. I'm here currently with Lewis, really a sport open pro and then we've got that really really like every week pro amateur, for his pro part we've got Matthew Sulek, open heavyweight amateur goes there's pro part. We're going to be catching up with Cala as well at some point. He really is open men's to seek, he's going for his pro part as well. We're very eventful. We came for the guys, Amanda is landing tomorrow. She's coming up with Cardi who's a physique pro, who's competing on Saturday and then we have two of her bikini pro competing on the Sunday. We're here for the guys final contestant. Okay, we just teamed up just to run through some exercises, move the food around, they've all started carburetor, didn't yesterday, so today it's just a start to reuse, that's the development of the pro session we say. I'll take a look at them upstairs and here with this much of open free we've got Crackin, heavy and beer as well, which we're getting some good shots at later. closer up in the water aswell as well. I'm walking only the back藏 pool and I'm going focus on the Copiat� here from the league.ễn Dar's busy following ribs And if I go up with you need to, I can go hard and out. So I'm just so much good, still good. Yeah, now I'm pretty good. Yeah. Yeah. I'm pretty good. I think there's the beach in it. I'm really happy to let me know. Because how many meals now have you got? I have one in two meals. Yeah. So yeah. I can still push good amount of food in now today. And tomorrow we pull out 11 steps. Even an athlete. Yeah, even pushing the water in the back of the little way. Or just see where we're saying, you know, you're like a sponge now. You know, everything's just in the sun again. So if you're depleted yourself and out of the glycogen storage, you can be like, the feel we feel we feel makes it. So it's going to work really well. Get that meal in it. And then like, I'm going to even give you another meal. So it's just like spacing out. So like, if you want, you may not be too, I'll work very good. Or you can go. Thanks. Really. Yeah. Honestly, really good. Really good. But yeah. I'm all the happy where we are. And food is really good. Yeah. And that's what you can do as an athlete. It's a groove. You know, you're better already. And it's just going to over 40 hours. So you can try a little bit. You know, this is where the fuck really happens. We keep pushing. I think like I said, if you have your meal now, and then I'll work out what we're going to do for the rest of the meal. We're going to do the back of the apartment. And then set the meals up in that job. And then you can go to the press. And then I'll come in. Come and get you a work. And get the image made up. You're going to be back. Whatever. Work out. But yeah. Keep doing what you do. This is marketing. Thank you. Yeah Good night. Can you put any more muscle in your road. Can we breathe? Yeah. It's not her job. What's it like now? Is it a little late on a day? Well, the strives and you've got to be a police man. Yeah, yeah. But that was just drier than it was. Yeah, it was. No, but I'm drier. It's drier than it is. It's a big team. Yeah, it's not really. It's checklists. With me, I'll say, see what the bubbles are going to be. Yeah, no, no. Yeah, sweet. Everybody's on. I'm happy. Everybody's fucking happy. Everybody's on. I'm fucking happy. This is very good. I, as a coach. Everyone's on the most stressful and in the weekend. There is zero stress when we all go to the place. Just brings a buzz. We can't cry. We're just sitting for the amateur. We're looking at just thunder for eight hours. And for the pros, probably about 52, 53 hours. I'd be in a position like this when we're not chasing anything. Everything is so easily manipulated at this point. With carb sodium, water, little bit of direct here and there. No, it's the puller that I'm pushing. You can do it this way, that will make a physique. Because everybody's in that prime position now. It's so easy. So, when they're going to show. What we got to do is keep repeating what we did. Let's go back to come Winston. I see a struggle there. I used to be a tiny. It's a strange, everybody. I'm going to grab to create a rise. It's a new cause of funny. And then we'll add some blueberries a little bit of away. Last day of sort of pushing carbs quite heavily. And then tomorrow we could just back a little bit. Let the GI stress subside. And then ready. A Saturday, game day. How'd you let any of your sidechairs in the test? Yeah, you only proved that that's not popular. Oh, it's going to be good. Let's go on your back. Then what's your last show? The last show. The warmest Texas. Was it two weeks ago? No, it was longer than that one there. Who was four? Who was four? Who was four twice a size? So for all the changes. This would take a mat in for you. So we are back at the Airbnb. The boys are coming at Camp Winston. So it's now coming. Extremely happy seeing the guys after their final session. Everybody has some form of lowly in yesterday. Some heavy lenders. Today is pretty much day to one or two guys. We'll push a little bit more of a rest of it tomorrow. Everybody's on. Everybody's happy. I am stress free. Just really, really excited to see what's going to happen on Saturday. I'm sorry. My favorite part is for us. The guys that have been there. The inside of the flush. Three Monica has kindly come here to work on all the guys. Rather than us having to go into the Vigilia. The CS. She's been able to come here. She's been fantastic. She's now working on Matthew. She's not Lewis. She's got Danny and then Bilius. So she's back to the back. It's all going to help because they're going to feel comfortable. But flush in three. They're going to sleep well tonight. Wake up on the money is normal. And then pretty much tomorrow will be just a balance in act for everybody. And then Saturday is game day. The amateur should be on the run about midday. Caled the men's seat boy. He should be on maybe one half oneish. And then Lewis, the pro show of Bilius. Five PM with them think going on fast. And then they should be last. So it could be a pretty late one on Saturday. But it kind of late. Okay. So we'll catch later. Lewis is fucking sure that. I'm pretty sure I'll check in. And the trial gets each night. So they haven't caught a time. habil Efendimiz. So you smell party cold. I want to do somekindles. Cause I think. Superb those now. Yeah. You can see that. Yeah. Woo. Oh. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. That was awesome they to Cam Winston. It is. So, do 1.5 gram? 1.5 for centros. Yeah, thank you. So, he has... Matthews up, move it up, both for looking, freaking awesome. Matthew had six hours sleep, which, as of yesterday, he got four. Before that, it was probably getting about two or three hours, and night. He's not actually really well. He's actually... heavier than what he was for the regional, but he's fuller with more condition, which just... is that the perfect spot to be... again, being where we are now, you've been able to push a little bit more aggressively with fullness, and shows for it as physique, as legs are... in a much more better position now, than they were for the regional, and they were a phenomenal analyst, thinking better now. Moodies, a couple of pounds, a lighter than where we were at this point for the regional. He's... conditioned, he's fuller again. When you're in a position where there's more conditioning coming through, you can push a little bit more and be a little bit more aggressive with the fullness, which then pushes more conditioning through, because... tissue is pushing through to the skin, so it brings our illusion here in more... even better conditions, which is fantastic. It's just set there, but for the first couple of years of the day, just literally just posing every hour after every meal, see how they respond, the just animals needed. Lewis is still sleeping. He will probably wake in the next few days. 45 minutes. Do the same thing. Have a look. Lewis is looking incredibly dry. All the guys had a full lymphatic flush through from Monarch here, today they were pretty creepy, following that Lewis was like... the dry stuff they've ever seen in the night, even what's looking like is show day, condition last night. So today's going to be pretty wild, mubless. This is about our 16th show, 15th, 16th show together. We were doing the mass yesterday, and by like... I can beat Lewis and my eyes because I'm pretty much... I'm probably confident in that as well. It's so exciting to see how he's looking this morning. We've got a good map of how that's going to pan out of the day for him. He's going to be on a 5pm, which is a first of this season. He's not been in on an evening show for a long time. This is back in Europe a couple of years ago. So it's going to be interesting how that pans out, how the look looks. I know it's just going to get better through the day tomorrow. So... Because I have really seen this, he's not messaged me yet. Kind of silly thing, because he's still... He's a late-rise or anyway. So I'll get them through and sort them out. We have Andrew doing the PSA show on Sunday, some way for him to check in. And Amanda is joining us today. She should be up here a little bit, they're all tough to lean. She's got the carli, he's doing the same throw and the two would have to be a bikini pro on Sunday. So... That's me. Yeah, where are we? I'm caught on there. You bet fresh. Everybody's on. Lewis is now alive in Kithyan. Just welcome up even more. What's sticking in him. Minus, the green heat. Both of them really good lighted. He's looking... ...dry like... ...in dron. Honours really good for us. I was leaving loud through this crowd, but we're throwing a sauce-based pretty well with him. Pretty much just a loud coasted in Mount Heese. Thank you for joining us today. Thank you. Thank you. I'll stay here. I'll stay here. I'll stay here. Everything's up. Still alive. Please, place it. It is slightly better than the Texas drone. It comes off in top four, fourth place, ...whacing in Texas. So this update that you're looking at right here was the most recent one. It's two days old. It's up his back. He looks really impressive here. My name comes in another update. Four days ago. But I wanted to show you guys that I felt really, really, really, ...arrily was the level of your nasty, ...lether day that he's displaying in this. You can tell he's in the racing condition. And I think as you watch this video, ...who's free. We'll go back in a really Markers update. Well, I said about really, ...maniacally this could be a very condition-focused competition. I've been how I felt that William doesn't look super peeled in his updates. It's up there, it's like this from guys like Louis Bree. That made me think, William's condition is quite up to stuff here. I'm so much better. I'm so much better. I'm so much better. I'm so much better. Jowls again. Ah! I think he's not a level of perfecting fuck. I'm just not a level of pretty much fucked. It's not gonna end down. I'm trying to break into the wall. So we did the same year as the Sp�. This is plenty. I'm just getting harder, drier. How you're posing through the reef, as well through your armstring and the duck is much better. It's a really, really, really perfect way that you're holding it in and when you're up, you're not releasing your duck, that was in. Making it work really well. So that's what I'm doing. It's a good distance crazy. I thought I was just back to life from where it was this morning. I was just going to go back up again, which was good. There were three for the one I see. So, that's it. No, no. This way you show, because that's right. That way you can't put it on my side, but you're way round to me. What? You can't put it on my side. You're way round to me. What? You can't put it on my side. You can't put it on my side. You can't put it on my side. Here's where you're. Here's where you're. Who's pretty sick of that? I'm like, I'm like, I love my heart. I don't care. Yeah. Good night. This is about, come. To the back. Where is your seat? The counter. And one stage. It's just wacky. The dryer. Harder. Fullness is. You don't wait tomorrow. That didn't look so bad. It's not working. It's working. It's not working. Oh, John. I'm never gonna find those go open spots. Yeah. Yeah. Very happy. I don't know you don't like the way you look. I don't care about that. What's the deal then? You're always gonna... It's basically... In two hours time you could feel an acid. It's just... You're like a batch of ever-wise. So you've got to get it? So you've got to get it? So you've got to get it. So you've got to get it? So you've got to get it? So you've got to get it? Yeah, just... Yeah, just... Yeah. It's... When you come onto stage, you've got the line. So you just go off center line slightly. Yeah. And that's gonna show out your hit it. So you're here then you might be interested. Yeah. Because your mid-section looks better in that pose than trying to hit the dory. Yeah, the dory looks cool what I should say. Because it's... Because it's a new pose. I'm a bit like... You know what I mean? You know what I mean? The last thing I want to do is... And think it's a smooth transition around to... Yeah. So that's what you can practice maybe. You know, for future shows, a dory and one. Yeah, a good thing to do. Just a twist on that side chest as well. Like... Like... I've worked with shitloader on my mobile at E&R. Fucking twist. And you're like... More and more. I'm like... I'm trying. But like... It's the mobility. Yeah. Yeah. But think it's even in your court when you're doing this. You can see it. It's bringing that top line. What you're doing now is just getting that little bit more rotation around. Just talking about that. It's a bit... It makes you wear some smile because you're... Yeah, because I do do it. And then I film myself go. Yeah. Just like... Yeah. Just like that. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, it's... One point. Just keep doing what you do. Next year was normal. I started 40 years with that scum. Yeah. And then you know what happens from then? Me. So everything's just sucking. Yeah. You're waiting for this. Like this is pretty much where you're working when things take a good... Just getting it a lot of not freaky. Yeah. Like, literally, it's like, none of them have been painted bleeds. They go with thin box, solid tissue and leather. That means... That means... That means... That means... That means... That means... That means... That means... That means... That means... That means... That means... That means... That means... That means... It's good. This is good. Detail for your hamstring and glutes. Yeah, glutes are still in out more. So that little crease underneath your glute. Before we are seeing when you're flat. It's now still in out nicely. You're getting dry through that area as well. So it's just like sealing to the skin. It's good. Everything's moving in the right direction. We're getting another big meal in. And then I can see you in person again. What I do is I'll... What time did you eat? Hey, that one. Look. Yeah, it's only been like one hour for you. So getting another meal in. Maybe in like 45 minutes. Yeah, he always takes me. Yeah, I'll get back and message you. But then what I do is I'll give you another meal to take with you. To the first. To the first. Registration. We're getting some fat out of the nose. Here you go. We finish it on. We'll be in the next. Yeah Beautiful I'm gonna catch it You're gonna pop it What's this guy? What's this guy? What's this guy? What's this guy? I'm gonna tell him what I can feel flat. I knew just had a layer of time to smooth everything out. So we're here at the venue, the soft silk boat's out. He's throw the Europa pro. Cool if I. No, less, the less. Really. Matthew. Here. Well, we're on Khaled's mainstay. Matthew's on his time. Matthew's on his time. Louis and Billy are sitting in. You're a good. Everybody's happy. Everybody's happy. Everybody's happy. Just a matter of just getting this out of the way and getting back to the Airbnb. It's just a bit of an end. It just got an edge as I'm praising. Detrain me in his end. It's about not that. Not too long before we go, minutes. So once I stand, everybody's dead. It's good. Said, I'm on a looking at everybody. We go back to, I've pretty much just assessed the last meal. Everybody's the best. We're waiting tomorrow at the money. Let's give it to girls. We'll catch you later. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. Check out his deck. We'll see. Look at this. I can't see that. You're a good one. You're good. You're a good man. You're a good man. You're a good man. You're a good man. You're a good man. you There you go. The Tard of Art. Lewis would have a rotation on, but they were doing this side. And I, you know, I grew up, like half. And I'm like Tisha. There is a school where... Absolutely. That's what we're doing. Więc, too. We showed the two losel n colour That's fine. Yes. What's going on? Very good for him. Yeah, I think we can keep pushing. Because you're not getting dry, you're not. He is, so I'm not. Mid-section's tight, so out here. Do you feel good when you pose like that? Yeah. He's arm. Yeah, so you're on 20 hours. Yeah, we got another whole day nearly. Yeah, but like I said, you're a rather push. Yeah. Push now. If you got any more meals prepared or is that the boys? No. But you feel the next meal? Yeah. Yeah. Well... Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Okay. Yeah. Good. Good. Yeah. Yeah. We have visited many places that can come in from Europe. Yeah, really good. It's game day. So, is it right? Yep. Yes, yeah. I don't know. No. So I think it looks... It's Saturday morning after... Come with us and there's something called... Yeah. I'm one of the other people in the pro. Everybody is looking for a good person. Just taking a look at the first time this morning. Very, very happy. The other boys' aeropop are like four o'clock, so they'll be up and then seven bucks a bed. Lewis might just stay in bed for a bit. So I can now feed them some more food. It's top and up. We'll be on stage for five o'clock tonight. So it can be a pretty long day, but we're in the best position right. Now, a couple of decent sized meals in. We know that works well, and it literally just keeps them right in a solid position before we hit the stage. So, yeah, they look pretty crazy this morning. Dry. You know, that makes it lovely. It's such a... Lines in the air. Everyone, lines everywhere. Bubbles in line. Bubbles in the middle, so. And... The starting part. And... Yeah. I'm happy. I'm tired. We're doing this. We're doing the back. Back. We're off the bed. On the floor. When you're just trying to put your hand in the chair. There. That's it. Remember that. That's how you go. Have your house. Okay. Don't know. See that image. You need that block in the studio. That. Perfect. My bed has dry. It's fine. It's fine. That's what you'll stay in your bed. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. So Matthew is one meal in. He weighed the... What was your weight in the morning Matthew? What was your weight in the morning? What was your weight in the morning? Yeah. Not yet exactly the morning. Felling. Pretty big meal. Good night, Fled. And he's still not yet yet. And he's still not yet yet. And striated to fuck us.

So yeah, but now it's like I feel like I've got, so this was supposed to be my last year and I say it every year and it never happens and then I just feel like there's like unfinished business now and that I don't actually need to go right off of season and go back up to 80, do you or me and go back up to that 85 kilo, stay relative to condition and then get more condition and do you have to work as hard to get into condition? Yeah, yeah, so yeah, what should it be? It might not be the last year, but I said it was the last year. As we all know, like, everybody is one of those things I like, the more show you do about you get, everything I'm gonna show you and women's physique is that the condition is better and better I mean, hardly fade unless you're born as tired, obviously our body's not tired now, so she could and she really get tired and I know Kylie does, like, women in 2021 show her the show, show her the full show, our nose and she fucking at 90 by then and it is one of those things because it's like two, like six after a year, yeah, yeah, so possibly the anime for shows that begin in part of the year, yeah, yeah, a few together, European ones, yeah, and for like ideas, to get show, yeah, yeah, it's fine, and I had to, yeah, yeah, yeah, that'll be, I would like to go through her plan to do, all you go to the TV, now she's broke her eyes for two years, off, you need to earn your stripes and roll-y, as always say, you need to come back, show him moments to the same judges and keep fucking going, if you love it, then you'll keep going, and if not, you retire, but also, hate is it, she's now 40 free so she could do, you must as well, yeah, because they got mastered limpia at 25, so why not?

For the long, he UK who is free. We are now at the Red Cross, the White Cross. Today, we are very good there. It's been a very good day. It's been a very eventful busy mixed bag of emotion days. Yeah. That's pretty much it. Just summed it up. Louis is just a little staves, pays and third. And it is 10 o'clock at night. Very long day. I've been up for a long day. I've been up for a long day and check it again. I still do check-ins now. Yeah. I've got a guy on my mind. Just a few people. Just a few people. From everybody, it's all positive. Louis is best.

We are going to get some food. Make it some snubs without the meal. Make it a little break. Day 2 at the Europa Po. We now got tilde athlete. tilde athlete. Lux. Take free. Day 2. We have tilde. We came here. This is the second show this year. Last year, last week was her pro W. It was a pro W in bikini class. She got a pro car 2 years ago in wellness. She is downed by 40 pound of muscle. 40 pound. It was crazy. You are not feeling this warm. The group is still in full. Basically last week we were going to feed back. How to apply to go into this week. That is what we have done. We got a different tan. A little bit of a different approach. A little bit more fullness this week. I think it is really nice to have another panel of judges. I will see what she is going to do. Tell the how do you feel? Honestly. Really nice. It is very much happening this week. It is getting to show us well. It is not on the show. So we are honest. I feel really uneasy. I would lie last week. I cannot be back in my confidence. A lot. Although the feedback was mainly positive. It has got me feeling really uneasy for the show. I am hoping that we will be back. I am posing in a different way from last week to high scenarios of my physique. That is a week point for the bikini class. However, six days to change your posing is a lot. It is not a lot. It is a lot to see again. And not a lot of time to do it in. So if you are feeling a little bit uneasy for presentation. Why is on stage? Which is as bad as it can get for bikini. But I can only try and roll with it. I am just doing my best. And I hope that the 10% where I have got the posing right. What I have been practicing lately is the 10% that shows up on stage. See ya. We will see. Thank you. Not only that though. She has also had a lot of stress to speak in the industry. I am not just trying to say that I have seen. Can you see his stick? Wait, which one is there? I am going to throw it out. Don't. To Dean had a really bad car crash. It is always this. I am very stressed with them. We have been one week come back to meeting him. But they are still fucking here. So we are just on. And yeah. Please, though, it wasn't my fault. Dean is a very good driver. I have been in the car. I have been my convouch for that. And the guy came onto his side of her. I had a head on collision at 80 miles an hour. So it was a really big crash as well. Yeah, the external stress has been there. But she is still pushed for her to be here. And she is a little soldier. So let's see. Let's get him. It was a little stick. Anyway, that's it for now. Bye. We should have booked big swamps. We have booked all the same. We should have booked the tracks. We raise me and I will pass. We need a snap. We need jewelry. We can see a pump on. It is the largest serving can. Delk. This is new this. With a teeny mic rate, it's happy to be here before. Make sure you have it. We are actually in no habit. I'm a CB. People are going to go wrong. You can try to see too. I've got a couple of people. I want to see you. What did you say? No, I'm completely going to break my question. Well, I'm very good at it. So for a few shows now, I've had the feedback of my tan. Not looking quite right with my hair on stage. We've had a few times from different judges to be fair. But we're actually doing something about it because you've got it really. I've tried to wig once before and it didn't work. So we are currently topping up the tan because we've noticed everyone else is a little bit darker. And the protocol this time has been a lot of base coats. So mixing a warm base coat and an ultra dark base coat. Doing layer upon layer upon layer upon layer over the course of like two, three nights before the show. Dean has been my pro tan man and a man with the steady hand or not so steady hand was pouring the two mixes together. And we're just going to do another layer because I'm a little light. But this keeps the tan really warm. Instead of going that sort of dusky gold color I've appeared on stage for the past couple shows, which my hair kind of looks a bit blonde under the light as you lose the red headness. So I just looked merged. So this should help stop that dirty weird color blend. So wish us luck. Oh, right. Just totally never see on it. Terrible. And I thought one that wasn't sealed in there as well. So I don't know why I'm just saying that it's easier. I'm just going to put it in the back. I'm just going to put it in the back. I'm just going to put a little bit of light on the back. I'm going to turn that thing like a mood so she's going to go back. Maybe I should put my bright mood to be better and I think going on that back layer do it. I'm not pushing them back. And I'm just going to bring this to spin around. I think that's actually a good idea. I think that's actually a good idea. It's super good to be with this system and a good mood. I'm very short. And that's actually a good idea. I'm going to put it in the back. Let's do it now. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. Place your chocolate aside. Please make sure we're at an expert level. Maybe there is one more... � bebeli Don't be afraid One thirty nine to one thirty five switch things And that is a Europe. I think we're going to be able to do it. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Music And that is a Europe. Let me a bit. I'm not leaving. She's leaving inside again. Been a very busy weekend. I think Europe is a complete job done. PCA done to him. PCA done. So I had the new one guy in PCA. Andrew, fantastic. He got first and got a short. Just missed out on the overall. Which is, you know, as always. He had fantastic real joy of people down to the British for him. And I'm going to pass the mic over to... Yeah, so we was at a short free, joyous feedbacks. And it's so interesting to see that every single chance has a different view. It's hard to say. Because Tyler basically said, not anything we thought. Nothing about a peak, nothing about foreigners. Nothing about communication. It was like upper outlook loop in these more development. Which I suppose would then match her level loop. Didn't say that she needs to downsize her, so it's because she has told last week. And it's these work on a front post. So get that more hourglass shape. She's going to show it around, but she doesn't like to do, because she has a wider way to try to, you know. Trying to do what's best for your physique sometimes. Then shoot soon of foot because then just don't bring in the shape they want to see. If you haven't got that shape then how would you post, so it's a case of this twisting around. And try and see what they next time do it and see if they don't like it. Then JP said that she turned around to the back and said, whoa, glutes. He said, if her didn't wellness natural next year, rather than wellness bikini, because wellness for natural would be more her size, because the natural bikini, I like tiny that were children he said. That was because like view. Then he spoke to Javier and he said she needs more upper outlook loops to go in line with the quad and to put her feet in more so her quad speed can't see from behind. And then he basically said it's the luck of the door too, because I could tell you this. And then you could tell another show and everyone looks different. And it's who you're standing next to and who the judges are and the day the panel changes. And we all know that I'm pretty, that was cool. So anyway, we didn't, did I already say what happens earlier? Yeah, yeah. Yes, we've worked well placing and then I've had a free glints at PCA today, so that also had. Joe on first, he was the first time as first on stage. If he spoke for the invites to the British out with six or seven, come and what he said. And then we had, we had Naomi and Sarah in the same category, bikini trains, so. Naomi was fourth for the invite to the British and we got a second place for Sarah with an invited British. And that is, everyone done for the weekend. And my brain's fried. Over and out. Yeah, the Martin final, bye bye. Bye bye. Next time, we're going to the next time. We're their name. Yeah, probably the British. Yeah, probably the British. Film one nice, next you, too. Next you, who, for now. Bye.

Okay so welcome back to our YouTube channel we are here at our live month final show of the season it's been a really good run so far obviously you're to see in Twain's A and one Masters for fifth in an instructor at a county the following week we're going for an open so we change plans so we're going to Portugal which is free weeks later we've fought with combat for state and do LA for the final show this way it landed really nice the one's birthday so we're having a week out here obviously I can pizza today so far those guys like Wednesday Wednesday Wednesday Wednesday Wednesday Wednesday Thursday Thursday heading home and also we're doing a phone up for the little holiday so that's called I don't want to lean up to it we are basically around the same as we were at a county baseline weight as pulled off a little water as hold of the county pastries over the four weeks I'm a little bit higher on the scouts but conditionately it's slightly better you you were able to push a little bit you didn't even use your strongness out with the gym following the Spain which is good like the food's done a good job and rebound in a very short period of time now you can utilize that it was maybe pushing a lot of glycogen through the muscles and it worked and I think that will help with the Z also the service with period of obviously being a deficit for so much longer is naturally your fatal you get faster from me I'm one of those Z's that gets better because I just nearly long the diet and phase to get that harder drive look and that is very individual to so I fix one thing I think to a lot of my clients is where is you can you can peak for a show and be 100% full of that show because your body's in a position where it can only go so far once you've done that show and tick that box and then you're able to move on almost that respite post show allows the body for this field the reset feel a bit redue and it's been hard food it's had rest and then your motivation is high to push forward as well as that drives you and then the body's up and you can eat out an extra one or two percent which then delivers potentially a better look stage it can like must be a mine name because like serious after the cancer again so in key place so those people go I wouldn't pull it back and not lie and I said to myself a few times fuck I'm not going back and I'm going to go back but I'm actually you know that comes up to peak when you can get in better and better than what was at the can see so it is just in the process that you say to your clients all the time and I was to to myself as well trust process but here we are and it's where it's and this hard because now you're at a state's could you've been lean to this long I think of that I actually think my condition is normal now I've been dieting this name number and that's as a give you a good idea as well of how long you can diet for the belt moving the muscle yes you're going to cycle as a little bit tissue now time we're not massively in it to put it's going to be detrimental against your results because obviously I've done the best of them this year despite being dieting this name number and then moving on so I'm not buffing too much about that now we are day two being here we flew over on Wednesday eventually we've martin I nearly didn't make it very very luckily made it so my Esther is collected to my passport everybody knows my passport when it's sort of when I'm watching when the one machine didn't work basically through a couple of customs I've stuck in a couple of airports so I changed my passport but little did I know that you have to change your Esther to go with your passport so no to people change your passport if you change your answer no other than what's up to the airport just about the check-in so I thought you can look at me became really really out of here still be the traffic was horrendous and massive car crash so we've got an hour hour out of four check-in so actually it was really really good because we even hour went into a flight for the Esther before the last check-in time yeah and it got to the last check-in time wasn't that I went through about him hey boom babe I'm going with a girl by myself now I get through to the plane and he's on the plane before me I'm like how the did you get before me so I met came five minutes after he'd baked the lady to be able to do three basically and got a score to probably to the bank which was nice surprise for me because to be fair I was worried but what I do the have ran because he's a man and charge of all the like plans and actions and I have no clue I just fall out of the suit eat the food drink the food drink the food drink the drink seriously do the training and let him plan all the city every holiday we go and anyway it's like a normal holiday or that one good car I had driving to the end to the apartment block it was 24 hours of traveling and total yeah I was holding water from the planes I'll see if it's gonna happen and that's already most people all in the world condition you end no car by j s if it's 11 hour flight like that even a whole water so we know it's a little bit water tension my ankles and feet the veins are gone but by the next day I dropped off back on space line a little bit of manipulation yep and then the food started that was yesterday so keep it survived yesterday he missed all the food action then he's gonna get some crochet we have how much it's gonna get 50 grams 700 grams of carbs just today we're on the same as what we did for at a canty we're kind of repeating it because we know it worked really well and a bit today's a wash off day so two carb mills in then I'll put them back a time is it now we have 11 so basically this is time I am now finishing off my last bit of enjoying some water to it is in and put them back I am one of these people at whole of water so some people can cut this out of it for me I will cut like take what I was out I'm a little bit of each mill obviously but still it's what I've had on stage and still we've pissing like back stage I was like in the line going anything and you hold your phone with the quick pick and the whole phone is yeah so right I know for a while that I'm better than trying to make a little bit out of the end try to put a little bit of water off which was a feedback by the way as well so just touching on that feedback from Tyler himself was a little bit more water off the quads no more tissue and basically from the front up to a really nice X-frame the world turn around I can't open my back up enough to portray that X-ray in the B-faper so I need to go out on that back pose get a water off my quarters two go for that qualification just here and those were two go for that qualification maybe I think oh do you know what I got this I can actually maybe possibly hit a top three in an approach I was never beating myself before so that was cool and that's where we are now trying to manipulate that water off my quotes because that for me is a poor matter area and like how hard I'm like what I do I just hold water in my quotes and you can go too far and then everything's like the voices which is the lovely joy of being able to keep you can control things and knowing your body inside out is somehow basically just replicate what we've done but you know we have a bit of harder yeah a bit harder just so we can have to think and pull through through the clouds and hold the full see what happens basically yeah it is now time for my meal free which is actually my last half meal of the day then it's going to be chicken and nut bar for the foreseeable yes and we'll cut you out registration which is yeah is that weird oh not um not bar and baby not bar and baby but it's not no baby but it's fine is it an onion big or is that gonna be weird or we just put the nut bar with the chicken and rice I mean that was something's the best delicious I don't know try it it's try it on so we're gonna find out if peanut butter and everything bagel which is only legal hmm that's your way we can't wait no it's not but maybe cause onion yeah it's okay Harvie Over here. The steering wheel is gonna automatically operate. . Good afternoon, my name is Ron Sprance from the Vice President of Operations here for most of the time. I'm just interdational. Welcome to the 2020-24. You're on a road to our early approach. We'll give you some of my shows sometimes I have to look at. Welcome to this interview. Good. No John O'Ranke. So this show is actually new in the Petrshada Road to Accusions. One of our judges for the really good one at the time. And sadly she had listed in the coverage in a few years back. And so, you know, we've lost her life. And because of that, and her relationship with the show that we made this show after her. So this show is really an honor to her. And I wish so glad you could all are here. And helping us to, you know, not only be a show here for you guys, but it's lost upon her memory. Okay. Amanda Winston. You know, the cake of all the way through that cake. Welcome. Okay. It's not like I'm looking at my first one. Yeah, that was very you, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Come on, Amanda. Do you have to do this? What do you want? Okay. How are you going? You buy either one of these or both. You get this one for three. That's it. Yeah. So that is registration done. 13 girls in Amanda's class. A couple of Olympians. It's going to be an interesting day. She's just looked after this with it. She has a final coffee. She's not going to go with this. So we're going to get her a huge black coffee. Because I didn't go very good. You just see her just dry and out. We're actually through the day. I've got a few of them saved this weekend. So it would be a pretty crazy one. I just picked those up. Guys, you have just registered in a Holland. I'll be over there and I'll be over there. The classic, yeah, two kilos to make with about six hours to go. So I'll pretty much stay there for all the night. About three hours sleep. Making sure that he was on the couch for a very good registration. Which happened, which is fantastic. All the way to show that I'm going to stress out and go back and forth. So that's the Irving's done. He's resting and eating in his room. I've also got a bomb. He's doing a piece of the show in the UK. He's going again after we do it for all the win. We're a little bit heavier this week. Because we've got the opportunity to know about cap on PCA. So it's fantastic for him just to see what he's seeing. Looks like a bit maxed out. And then we have the Vancouver Pro show. We've got to show him figure in that show. She's looking fantastic. So just managing all these together is as well as doing the show. It's as well as doing the normal things they've set up with clients. It's a bit hack-dick but we love it. Making sure the man just okay and chilled. She's at a point now. I actually think she's fast 24-7. She's feeling for the moment. So just like reassurance. I think as well, it was just a keep in there in a good position. On the bomb excited she's done me so proud. She's in the dark in the sense that she's not that much. She's in the dark. She's in the crazy. But now we enjoy. This is a long time. We'll talk about eight nine months. And this will potentially be a lot of the last show. With the season for sure. Maybe her last show ever. We know that could be one more show. It's the right to my answer. See, that's the end. Hi. So, Tan is done. Can you tell? I don't know. She had a more hawk in the. And that was by it. Was a day of her session done, Tan done. We're going to go back to our apartment. Yep. And make it to three. My friend Megan's coming over from Cali. Oh, she's wearing Cali now. Oh, yeah. What's up? South Kansas here. He knows more than me. So she's come to watch show. So I'm going to go back meet her. That her answer is how. And she'll put even an eight peanut butter on the show. Yeah. No for an out. Yeah. I'll see you tomorrow. I'll see you soon. You're sorry. I'm going to kiss and you're trying to kiss. What's up? We're going to kiss. Oh, I see her wearing it. Go. She's dizzy. She'll be alone. I'm just chicken in that boat. So this week. I was looking at pretty much hundreds of me. Around the class today. Across two meals, the rest of will be for a fast chicken. I've had water. I'll be in one group. I just try to make it very, very, very, very, very, very, very special. And then we've back off a little bit, works really well for our 60-folds. and then essentially it's about the size of the food. Look like Jinsa from the tissue she told me. I did mine, I just cut it in every time. I'm going to move in that cellar, I think this is what I'm going to do. And we're here in the final, the Marius of your stage at 11. No, that will probably wake up about, we'll see we have about five or six or five. I'll probably go back to the next. They'll actually know if something is seen as a guide on it, but we'll be careful and make sure we have the right way. We've got, so tomorrow's going to be a long day, because it will be a long day, because it will be a long day when they're on stage. So it's going to be a bit more of a week and a bit of a week. So of course, we think it's more of a year. Yeah, I'm just not very good at it. It's a bit of a year, but it's a bit of a year. So we'll see. I'll see. I'll see. I'll see. Let me show you. Oh, we done? We done? She had a mind. So, it is Shoday. Oh, yeah. The man doing his gas. Just going around the woods and we've just arrived at Casa de Coupes. The hill and whether the show would be in Haud. The man there is the best you've ever done. Not the she feels it, but I feel like she looks there. It's like anybody, maybe in the head. But she's looking really good at it. I'm here. No. I'm always there. What's hard is it? I think it's weird. So, three hours. I was off time at 80. So we just got here and I literally go to the make up. You can watch that, Bob. And go out the time. Then I think moving the hair off the time. Then I take them to curl off the end of the. And we're going to 11. So, 10. 10. We started 9. We're going to 12. Yeah. Come back up. Do the hair. Yeah. So I was going to be at this and then I went to have a death. That was the plan. And then I'm going to get some more scramble. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Right. So we did last time. Yes. Yes. We're going to have a car. No. I think I'm going to go out. Do some right. Because if you didn't. Never put. I thought we were doing it out in later. I think I'm going to go out. Is there a car? Yeah. It's time to eat. I know. This is love. I kind of stand. Peanut butter. But literally making the guy with. Oh. Now coming out. We haven't got spoon. I'm using a coffee star. Try and get peanut butter. Oh. It's like that. I'm going to get a kiss of mango. Which is a peat in this. Back. I'm going to be doing my eyes after I think. Because it was a bit late for my time. I've been up like 40. I don't know how I'm sort of late. For about 5.15. I've made my attention. Oh. It's okay. I'm going to see that. So yeah. Thank you so much. I'm going to touch you. Check your photos. She's all getting up and touch you. And six weeks up. I was so emotional. I was so emotional. I was so bad. I was like 11. Yeah. You'll see the glutes on the squirrel. It's my first one. Then woke up. Team condition count. And the water from the one. And another three. I'm going to argue with our feedback today. She's happy to wait until later. She knows the plant. Plan has broken. She needs me to be tonight and go again. Yeah. Either yes they're going to. Sorry to bother you. akt. Yeah. You gonna go? Good to be. Push. All my effects? It's done. I think there's someone fit in line. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, what's better? There's a seat. I'll see you on the way. I'll just let her hold my bean hurt. Oh, stay. Oh. There's a little guy that's hang on the fix. Good idea. It's been a year, but it's been a long time. Yeah. We've faced a bad approach. What is it called? Awesome. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Go on it goes to say or run? Close by rolled out this big line. You mean to say? Go on cocktail? Yeah. No No wayи sey dou legs cold no machine sprite We're going to be back for the 24th. We're going to be back for the 24th. We're going to be back. Keep it safe. Keep it safe. We're going to be back, babe. We're going to be back. Yes, Amanda. What's up, babe? Yeah, man! What's up, babe? What's up, babe? One of the 10s rich. Yeah, man! Come on! Go back, reset! What? What? Yeah, man! Go back, reset! I've been told the genre of the 21st century. All the way from the UK. Amanda, Amanda, Wissin. I'm going to go back. I'm going to go back. I'm going to go back. I'm going to go back. I'm going to go back. I should have, like, to the ground. One, two, three, speak. Huh? I could ground bread. Yeah, me. Yeah, me. Yeah, man. Yeah, man. I could have turned the ground back. I'm breading me to start a full month. What we get in more meat, yeah. I do move this menu, it's covered in cream. Are we going to get in? I always have a half-pumped apple show, like, or ice. So I thought I could get traditional meat again. But I also wasn't fried, she-she-she-she-she-she-she. I wanted to eat it. Fried from cheese. Yeah, pizza. Yeah, pizza. Are you going to get a cheesecake? Yes. Because of the freshness of the wits. Which one? Actually, I don't know. And the last one I last. I think I have my lunch piece. Yeah. You can see yourself now. You can see yourself. What? Do a book. I don't even have a whole weekend. I don't have a weekend. So, where do you get the cheesecake, Badgey? About cheesecake. I just got the one to go. So I went to the carbonara. Of course. Carbonara. How's that? Cheese and fried cheese. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. You're going to take your bite. You're going to have one. Fucking. Cheese, thank battery. Done. We are literally fine food. And a lot of food. Amanda's sat outside. We're chilled. And so, a little bit at this point in the night. I can't wait to come up with a back end of the two very good results. It's a ronso. And I can't see. I'm coming here. We've cleared extra things to do. Well, Miss Louise will receive you going. Come up with back end of two shows. And then you go to another one. You almost sat expectations to a certain degree. Which sometimes you shouldn't really do. A new judging panel. Awesome. There's our feedback. Amanda's in the first call out. And then just shifted around and just outside of the top call out. So maybe like a six-cent of eight. Again, just very dear friendly to what she used the left one stage. Literally posing for about ten to fifteen minutes in one go. It was very great. So I thought, is what it is. It was also result. And again, you know, you can bring your best package with she bought the lake. And then get the last result of the season. So it was probably good. Basically I was eating too much. But this feel like a dance. I thought fine. And the moment it was good and let's make a ban. I can't move. So that's a good moment to do it all night down. But this is the end of the YouTube. Yeah. The dance did last show. The season done not finishing on the high. Unfortunately, not finishing on the better place in this season. But this year I said I wanted to get top five in one watch out. So I'm actually at that in two shows. Okay. So the first show is not so good. Got some feedback. It's just completely different to what I've had before. But always gives a new experience. And that's what I've got to think. It's a body boy in the evening. I don't know what's going to happen. It's a little bit different. Yeah, it's a hair to hair to hair. It's a stage of weeks. It's what it is. It's something else. What ends up? I need to get a light out from a belly mini house. Thank you for the pass out. I need to get my phone on. Two guys on the column. One's just broken up. So seven to four here. No. I think I will be up all night. So I will be the pass out on cheese cream. I got two guys in all of them. One in UK and some more in Vancouver. Just gonna be up busy 24 hours. I think so. But we'll catch you some time soon.

2 days 3 days Meep! Okay, okay. I'm leaving. Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! We are at the supermarket and first things first. I have all fritters to support and so that is all see mainly from mine. Getting on the food in many for this few days and a little bit of the carbub in there. Some nice treats for the carbub. I found Camel chopped it where it's kates. What else was that? Honey. I think we've actually got much. Right. Oats. Sticky rice, oats. Nothing so different. No, it's time. Peanut butter. I've found stuff. We really found some raisins. Raisins. Raisins are my favorite. What in the speed you are? I'm trying to find raisins but it's shattered by delicious species. Here we go. Oh my God. What's that? Cinnamon is black. Oh my God. Sweet and smoky mix. Oh my God. These are delicious. I love those, bro. Right guys, it's Friday. The more filming yesterday, it was pretty much where people were bone-said as landed or sea-cate from low food, standard pump sash. Children pose so today is a bit more exciting to film me. The carbub. Well, I've got 60.1 kilos which is based on the base land and hold that for a while now. We are going to have a look at me here first in this lighting and the gym because the brim is really shitlighting. So I would have looked at me a little pose and practice. Go back and sat in. So to start with anyway before we start eating, we get some good fluids in. I'm going to get about six or seven liters in a day. What I've been doing is all of average in the last couple of days. But some electrolytes. I love this because I hate water. So black down flavor. It was helps get it down. From six o'clock need of course. Meal one is 85 grams of oats, 30 grams of raisins and 30 grams of nutlap. I tried to make my way into a pace. It was nice to see it. But it's worked. So having that one is meal one. The idea is basically to have a higher carb later than the eight, which is two days out. And then back off of what you were away. Just because there were two heavy carbs before the shirt. And expanded my waistline a little bit and holding a bit of water. So I worked better doing that. It had a load now. Back enough of day before. And we'll see how that goes. And I'll be able to sort of trial for next week. So we are mill two. Martin, my lovely husband who's also behind the camera. My cameraman is also a moisture. And we've got 200 grams of cooked weight rise. It was 75 rolls in it. And I'm watching him. It's 75. You set your five grams of chicken and a putter kilogram of pink salt in here. And he just done that well. Been doing work. And I'm watching chains all season. It's last time I was talking to the camera. There's the fact that we're sitting down doing chickens on the Friday. A lot more competitors. I do on the Friday so it's getting fruit of that. And Martin's cooking what I eat. What's going with that meal? Oh, what got it so we're going to go to the train after this. So we're getting two meals in and then going to go train. Obviously not a heavy session just a push from carbohydrates to a run based on the in. Basically do a little bit of a push. Is it pushed today? And it's probably a nice little push session. It always went fucking doubt as well as does. You've been through the bathroom. And my person has been a bit of a good moods. And we are going to team the four seasons. So I put it there and then we're going to say that. Little walk there to help digestion and get to know clearly that it's pretty work out. Some people have muffins. We have proofers. I don't like muffins. Not about life. I know that point but the crew doesn't sit as well. Yeah. We do what works. So in joy babe. What are you doing bro? How many of them look? So we're going to go work out. And this is the pre-work out muffins. But it's 11 muffins. I think it's going to be a back. Or a good eat. What is your decision decisions? That a little scared. So you're going to do whatever you want. Yeah. That's good. But I'm going to give you a second. But what do you do? But what do you do? Okay. What is your decision? Decisions. That looks good. The same as that. What is normal grace? Old fashioned day and that's all the best. Only a bit of my own best. I'll see you at Canada for a minute. See you in the back. Excuse me as well. Coming to a way from England. I think everyone is going to be a hot, so I just packed nothing. And that will help my friends. See you whereas my clothes. All right, make a decision. What do you think? Old fashioned and old crueler. Honey crueler. Honey crueler. I do love no fashion then. I'll say, how do you feel then? Honey crueler. Done. What? Oh my God, so moist. A mouse and a mouth. So good. Pretty well done. I'm hoping the veins come out when I train. Happy. Happy wifey. Almost full of a guilty. Like do I want it yet? Do I want a room thing? Nothing. No, I want it yet. No, that's not good to use. Such a heavy. Ah. OK, so we are here at a pure muscle for the final session and a little push session. We're actually going to film some bits of the day we train in, so let's go. OK, so that is the last train session done. Four times been back again Monday to repeat some calls. Ready for it, I can't in it's week. We are literally going to go back to the apartment. Get some freeze and then literally head off straight to registration. I secured a little pump. Finally. Have? Don't up pump. That was good. That was a good job. Yeah, that's a nice, great. Need some more. And we've got some good photos to. We found some sick lighting in the gym, so that's cool. So, an engine drink, an engine drink. There's on the floor. Whoa, shaker. Another bowl. Pre-bolls. Peel tablets. T-shirts, bikini, stuff to help keep bikinis on. There's one of those little cookies. Not Ky or the KYK, YK, YK. There's literally like pre-protein bars, protein, crisp, protein, cereal, protein bites, and any bites. So, we need to get as a wake and we blow out the heat at all. And for now, we're at the end. Meal fight. I had another meal before this, actually, which was actually rice cakes because of 13, we're easy to trans it. You're only 200 grams of rice with 35 grams of chicken. We're going to get that in. Just when it's registration and then after this, we're going to make a way back and do delicious. Delicious. What fries were these again? Season fries. I don't know how many he got before. I'm guessing most of these for you. I'm about to put away that many fries. Double. And I'm guessing that one is the cow other. I sure is. All right, ratings are 10. Hmm. It's a good burger. How about 10? Hmm. Second bite. Second bite. Situinkles? Okay so it is a day before the show we've come down to our new position room because there's a lot in here so much better. It was good to do like a little comparison as well from yesterday's checking me being completely flat as pancake 2 after having 600 grams of carb just a which did include a broken chin and a cookie half cookie it's gonna boot heavy do you all the reason? We actually are a little bit drier, a little bit tired so I'm a little bit full of little legs just gives like always a worry about my legs for love so if it's a quite balanced today it's gonna pull back and do better than the fat but Martin thinks she put in a bit of carbs and still just a helpfulness to work out a little bit of fat than what he intended and we were of judge each meal by me as well as today and that's it and small posing today not much we were resting what time today at 2 to 20 so we're making a way over to venue there for the tan then back in till for the evening I've also got Alex on today back home at PC Natures she has made improvements since the last show she dropped 1.5 kilos trying to put a little bit more and she's looking on the money today so excited to see how she gets on so we are doing some more filming in Alphabes and this is morning I have had two meals since then I had my oatmeal and then I had a steak and nut butter to praise and fats we are now getting meal free in before we go to tan tan's at 2 to 20 and it is now quarter one I'm currently talking to Alex at the same time Alex Lord's our coach he's back in the UK looking over my client Alex at a PC A for me she's just gone third at PC A first one not for some of Natures and his client has also moved to the second note second call out for the set of stage that he's over the moon too the communication and what are still going and I am now by the career rise this is good but after he cake cream or rice it's actually really really really nice and the career rise is really nice and I'm only getting into that any of us want to go right now time at 220 I've got a lot of them I have washed my hair but right myself with that and I've got some bread brin too as well from some of the needs to help the carbohydrates going down part is patient with a couple of hard days and I'm dropping on the floor standard me and I'm going to go now so I can eat this because I'm really hungry hey cool so there's now 228 you've come down to the pros and cons we claimed non-convenient so it was literally our room to look at me after the last meal today so that is it loading and done we did a big day essay back up to the only 200 grams of carbohydrates I'm full this is even so I know I'm full and that's the case now I'll dry it out over the night basically okay now we're going to bed a bit I'm going to go into bed at half a seat and get another free 30 because we got dry by over for my turn at 5 30 but at 45 minute drive so I'm going to get nice and early for the first time the time is told us to wash this layer off so I'm going to have a wash in the morning and rinse it off actually we've really nice and so it is not stink get first layer done that's 5 30 it's literally straight to her at 6 10 straight into makeup at 10 to 7 and then I think a bit of stage about it getting a long which obviously in UK times can fly by the head of what I'm saying so that's that if we don't have one of these warm film and quickly cool we go as well so we're trying captures and much to come so it does so it's been morning it's 10 past four in the morning we are up very very early for hands at 5 30 quick come down to look at me we're very forgetful what we've got the camera I forgot what I'm making also nothing will be that great of checking but it's been a pretty other light and light so if we want to look at basically to plan meal one and then we're going to head up for time at 5 30 straight into her at 10 past 6 and straight into makeup at 10 to 7 so you're putting up a scene much of that because he can't be with me but we will show you the calm up it looks a lot better than it's what I come out the oven I Love you Did I wait you see i didn't mean every day what I know is but I think it'll come a lot a little bit of their pump. Yeah, they're feeling fluid. Yeah, they're feeling fluid. Yeah. I don't want to be too fasting. I want to give mid-section small. We don't need to literally ride that because it's a bit more mushy, because it's trying to lick it up. I look a little quite with it. I don't think they're... I don't see them in the judgment panel. It's a different one. It's a bit fluid. Okay, so we're back up. So now we're going to put the half-mill one. We have made how much grams of carbs again. How much grams of carbs again on the middle one. Which is from a clearer item course of these. Roughly cakes that have been best, literally. It's like, is a jelly cake. How much of a by-beaven? About number. Photocombs in that bar. And then, the phyhane, very amazing. It's delicious meal. Some of the lecture lights, some pink socks, all they got in, and also some heat max. Obviously they're helped to keep the water going off. And then, using some a little bit of geotage fillet. So, it's going to be too dry. But it's going to be too hard either. It's trying to find out about it as again. And that's it. Not that I believe you're checking the blade to go for the day. It's going to be a long day to do pre-judging fast. Then we will stay for the finals of our free-art walk. And then obviously I'm probably all about maybe a 4-pin of the head on the day to go and half of the day is. And so, imagine that in between is that. So, it's not like, cakes from food. So, you can rice cakes, the basics, the way it's cakes, not bad. That'll drop it. And that's it. I'm going to eat. Let's go. It's like, there's always a big delicious. It's not delicious. Just moving. Just moving. I'm going to the eighth quarter 31. Yes, Amanda. You're supposed to drink a lot. Hold on a minute. Off you go. Put your turn to the right. Yes Samantha. Put your turn to the right. Get face wrong. Get cover. Get cover. Thank you. And the two men are late. Number 26. Thirty points. Number 30. Yes, bye. Come on, Amanda. Come on. Let's go, babe. Yeah, Ashley. Thirty points. Thirty points. Thirty-six. Emily. Oh! Twenty-six. Seat, baby. 때�..? Reset baby.. Sev! Four-hoto. Four-hoto. Boardiers, who are moving, are second-class, these are ready! Come, just sit on the back of our sleeves. All yeah, that was real quick. We got some more� Commons today. Alright, we will continue Seth. You have to turn up So that's a wrap. The morning show is done. Pre-degent dumb. So no I'm gonna smash a dumb note, so I can't really. I will be quite calm because I thought I'd get back out because it looks like I was definitely made talk 10 and talk 10 and talk about the back one and a little routine. The masses was pretty good. I think I've ever first or second judged him by the position of the Nazi and then when I came out to do the open we was in the whole other game and me and the goal and the masses. Be real. Me and the goal and the masses were both there for the novice one place that's like I don't know. I love the fifth or six of them. I'm happy. So happy because I think some of my own is like five or in here and there's twenty more girls and I just honestly thought it would be in a total again we'd be good and been up in mix but yeah being that first what I was main with it. So we had done for the day. I have a long day. We got the goal so one, the masses it would for you if I and my goal this year was the place in the top five and I came to fit in the open class. Super super happy on super close that's the one thing I wanted to know basically get back on a diet and ready but at a canteen they can be. I just want to say like volunteer so far today and so happy that once been here I've let him be put ice for this fun time to peek me and it shows it works so there's like he's now my peak master and that's it so that's it.

So welcome to YouTube number two, peak week number two. We have arrived at the Nala Kanteen. This is the part of the week. Yes, there was a long old trip from Canada to UK UK to Nala Kanteen, so do any film and done. The case of go to Mara Kodana, get a food in for the week, train, sleep, and then wake up today. So we are back to go to Titan's gym to do a poor session. I am currently on a very low carbohydrate support water attention off of the peak and that's a case that we are here at Titan. What is on the intro side, there is none of me. Nala Kanteen, rain and a huge egg every time. Anyway, I have a bucket group of poor sessions. We are going to film a little bit of that, some clothes in, obviously a season of that too, and then we bring that massage feathers down around the head. There is onlyishing items that work through three sizes. So we have just finished back and buys. This is the only time my buy sets get a little treat as a peak week. We are now walking to this up in the store to get some cream rice. Let's go out and collect some of the treats. Unfortunately we had to ditch our cream and buy set the app up. So we are very upset by it too because I really like the pros to keep one. Also I need to find a massage from some of my friends to win my back, blame a martin, he was laughing and I looked over and turned it back. We are going back to some card, we are going to second once we have been to this up in the store because I also need to get a little bit of water way off from the flight. It's not that sauce. They actually sound good. We have got mustard flavour, pizza, pizza and everything flavour. Can we get these faster? One? One. Everything flavour. Do any syrup catchups? Sources. And all the treats. Films. Chocolate sauce, caramel sauce. Oh that one looks nice. They will save the let's say. You are good. Is it your yogurt? So which flavour are we going to get? It looks like there is only one. Chocolate monkey. I am pretty sure they had more mangoes on. They have just got chocolate. That is outflakes. That one is cookies. That one is white chocolate. So we got white chocolate, we got cookies. And we got chocolate monkey. Cookie or a can? I am pretty sure they had more than a corner. Is this cream or what? Yes, it is like roast flour. That is the same thing. This is ground onto more of the flour. Banana cake. And we have biscuit. Strawberry. Banana cake sounds good. Another good egg flavour as well. On my goat apple. Brownie. Brownie, what is the flavour? What one will be in the egg? Cheese cake. Cheese cake. That is oat flour. I am going to answer it. This is something to go. I am going to add some milk. Thank you, bro. So it is Friday. We are two days out from Alacanty Show. Lacy. And Katelyn here is behind the camera. I have now turned up to come watch me. Yesterday was pretty. It was pretty. It was pretty. It was pretty. It was pretty. It was pretty. Root and wine shoes are wearing glasses. Making me some. It was similar but I am still very kiddo. A cake would say. How is that going? Iいた out the poorfows. The cake ends up starting Butter at the dark snow but Analyze. We have done it a week and watched it. We going down the ice and the snow and then there will be more. I am not quite down to my baseline way. We thought this was pulled right down my arm. Someone's been flipping my face either. And I think I'm in a pretty good position moving forward. Yeah. It's just about just getting the right margin today, just making sure that the fullness is there because the feedback last week was literally just a bit of a tire free the glutes at hand, but realistically we can't magic that we've sacrificed in there. No, to be fair anyway, my groups and the hands do look tired this week, even though my baseline is up, so I don't raise my weight and go by weight. I put it still holding a bit of water from the fly, so I can feel like a tiny little film on my abs, but to be fair my abs are like really, really tight anyway, so it's not going to issue holding the film there. I've been more issue holding it here for me. Yeah, I've been a deep tissue myself because my backs bad, I've had an injured that blame not mine completely. I was doing a seated row and there's some stupid laugh of some guy and I thought it's been laughing at me, so I looked at him as I was revitted and bletching jolting my back and I got, oh that's bad, I had to stop training, but I managed to push anything in my back and it's fine, it's literally just sending a skin or a spray, luckily I can pose. So that isn't fishy, so that's good. If I can pose I can still fucking walk the walk. And that's what I would do is just a more film and let it all the film me get eat. Yeah, what would be today I just pose as well, I'm just going to have to push the water through. I sit. Right, so the food is going in, we're pretty much reputating the first meal of the last carber, but the nap to that one's on an online thing, how I look by the day today, Rubbing is not doing exactly the same thing because the body can respond completely differently each time. So it's two slash layers of the outer skin and then. And the ones from Canada, the amazing syrup and bronze sugar and the best. So put them in the real of course. Exactly the same. We've got a very good amount of eggs going in, probably down the raisins going in, 20 grams away, and we have got a fresh, pre-recut, muffin again before we go and do a pump session later at tight ends. And that is meal one, we're going to be putting some salt in here as well, a bit of minced sea and expel, which is a natural dressing for this meal. And then that's it, really just some rounds of pose in each time to push in the food rounds and obviously have a get. So I don't like cooking why it's on a bit of the ears, and a lot of people are like volume and cooking them up. I find when I cook them, actually makes most of them at the way. So just put them in the water and let them sit for like 5-10 minutes. And then the side of my raisins and honey, much much prefer it. Even though it's not high volume, I just find it's a little bit dense and sits better in my stomach. So again, it's another soups thing to do with your use and board order to be safe as well. And the different kinds of ingredients, you cannot try to pat water, you know, it's filtered that one. I've had a bit of a dodgy belly can drink in it, so a lot of risk in here. I don't even know how much calories in this, mate. What's this meal? I've been having my hair done. So we're replicating what we've done in, where are we? Twins are big. Twins are big. But we use Jasmine Rice and we had a amount of car from the Jasmine Rice and we had a Kruella. It's really different than this time. It's America Donna Muffins. We're emulating the fats and carbs, but we have a mixture of basmati rice, and more iscapes which do the... Supplement needs, verbin, how will the carbohydrates? It's chocolate muffins, so. I'm a little bit behind them, though, like half one is the milk tea behind the water, so I'm like a ghostly little bit like a big fatty in a gym, man. I'm posing for that, hey, here. Feel what's my heart? I'm just going to be a ghost. I've got my new function. So that is Afreece, Meeting, Done, Oversteer, and ready to roll for some day. Super, super busy show, literally the whole base. It's full of it. It's 180 Afreece, then. It's crazy, so. I'm not sure if I can get some food in. Get a taxi, get back, and then it's burger time. What game? U22 4 hours out from the Alok house at in Pro show? Friesie and Spain, but it doesn't sound like that. I can't enjoy it, it's not going inside, or nobody besides. I've just been the same Monica for a flush-free massage which is great. I've never had that before some compression boots. Just finishing off the rest of my wardrobe for today and getting my last carb meal in a second and then that'll be me for the rest of the day. Tilt legs up, proteins and fats until the show tomorrow. It's Sunday again. So day number two, my intimate breakfast. It is now currently called the pass at five in the morning. We didn't have about this early morning at 7.15 at the venue. So my arms just have a look at me. Give me 110 grams of carbohydrates going in now. If you pick up the hours before my tannies rose, I have another little look to see where we are at. Because I think the show starts at 9. Two categories before me, then me so probably beyond 10. Just have my very good and a little bit water. A little bit of water. And that's it. I started doing my makeup so if I look weird it's got just more problems. That's it. This week I'm doing my makeup. So I will be showing you that in a second and then I'll be making a touch up because the door is sleeping so early to curl my hair. And that is it. I will be doing some filming at the venue. Oh, it's melted. It's a good one. Then I'm going to play with my wife, my upper hand, my aeratians and my mouth about my muscles.

Yes guys, welcome back to the YouTube, it's been a while, we're here in sunny I think it's an Alicante with Antoine and he is making his open pro debut Antoine as an amateur can be as a bodybuilder, he transitioned into the pro league as a classic physique he's been to the Olympia. The struggle to make the week was getting a lot harder each time around and we had a discussion and we first got together and the plan was to go straight to open capitalise on what we could in regards to the growth time period that we had and then almost utilised the prep effectively to hold on to everything that we built to not sacrifice anything just to make a wake-up which is worked out well because we're currently sitting just around we're hover around about 10 kilos of buffers but it's classic capital which is going to be a good luck. It's been a good prep, it's gone very smooth, it's a lot different to preview. It's a good approach, it's been designed for the fact from a muscle retention and hold on to the electrician that we built. Going into this show it wasn't planned we did have poor school mapped out in a few weeks time but we had a conversation when I was in Spain a couple of weeks ago that maybe we can jump in you know it's it's I think you done this as well previously as well when you've ever been to the A for a Portugal show and ended up doing the M for a show and it's pretty much replicated at this time around you know so with confident the position when we had that conversation was good and it's like good let's make a couple of changes if we see the response that we want to see at that point over the next two three four days and I said to you by the weekend we'll make a decision and that was last weekend and yeah everything was there and then we've set a game plan registered and here we are so really happy and the bodies just wanted really well this week we actually hit a little yesterday after a day of travel at 5,000 on a train woke up like peel but the bleed it right where we want to be you know at that point and yesterday was a bit of a buffer day so we've been here from yesterday and because of the how far and from was depleted there was no point just holding there or just try to chase even more conditions there when you're going into a load of snow around and we'll need decent amount of food just to bring some fullness back to his Zig we've sort of done a bit of a buffer in day we've put in about 650 that we put in yesterday, 650, 650 grams of carbs just to pretty much hold we put in a small amount of fullness back in he's actually drier today than he was yesterday and it almost gives up that stomach a little bit of a warm-up a wake-up cool that you're actually going to be loaded with a shit ton of food since 650 yes it was the buffer day minimal weight gain 0.5 kilo with a drier look put 2.2 point points he's I put 2 of a kilo up and we've meant like minimal fullness but a drier with drier look at the day we got 1200 going in and that may adjust as we go through the day and we get 2 mu's in and train post-waka will have a look if I feel that that's not really touch the sides already it probably it won't I know they won't at that point anyway I feel like the digestion's going well and there's room to potentially push a little bit more today for the day that we can sort of do that because we've still got them Friday Saturday before we land into Sunday that's a big intro yeah excited we will go and train you've had meal 1 we'll have meal 2 and a bit we'll hit the gym a bit of a pool session with these and pose enough for that we'll catch it out yes guys we're here at the famous tightroof fitness gonna put on one through a bit of a pool session nothing crazy here like 88% move some blood around he's started loading we've worked well just over 400 grams of card in two meals so just move that moment moderately the aim of the gain here is not to go crazy super the plet everything we're in a position where we want the body to start filling and be in responsive from the from the moment we've seen the the morning to just have a quick look prior to coming here we can already see a response so it's going to be good move some blood around get a bit of a pump and have a look in the mirror so here we get and again one more keep it in nice and simple busy here today busy we just need to move some blood nothing crazy couple of pool dance couple of rows simple I do one weird out couple of buys just take a set of move the blood and basically just keep in primed ready for the carbs that are going in and tomorrow we'll do the final session which will be a little over up the session the jeel will touch up on all muscle groups just keeping the carbs moving around moving the blood Saturday it's horizontal day yeah no flush feeling fat of flush free from monica hot early in the morning rest of Saturday Saturday's planals a little bit of a back off day so we're going to be ballooning hard today tomorrow Friday he's off a little bit clear joy a few ice-based making sure that he wakes up super feel super full super flat I'm expecting a super flat for the stomach and Okay, I'll go.

Tired. Go ahead and put your go. It's competing tomorrow. It's been a highly early thought today. It's making sure he's paying and the guys are doing the bridge to follow him weekend as well. So, see you for a minute, for a moment. It's cool. Living off the window. Monster, caffeine, drop a bit. Let's get that made for the shit. As soon as the Lewis is done on Sunday we fly back to Vegas from Reno here on the Monday. Tuesday we fly back to UK and I have straight command just to set up camp for the guys are doing two brochures and then head straight to South Africa for the BCA. So it's going to be a long time away from home. Listen, everybody sucks. That's all for good course. Really good. It's time to eat some good down time at the end of season as well. But it's getting tired in the end. It's a good deal. Lewis is now a mute. The saving is a voice to save his throat. So there's no point in the mic anytime. He is actually silent. He's still being a little bit, but he's hundreds, hundreds of times better than Murray where a couple of days go. It's a scar. It's actually pulling out the choke, eventually. When he couldn't even hit one hose without it's been gasping for about 30 minutes. It's a bit worrying, but thankfully, he'll always be catching a humidifier. Throats, spray, and septic spray, every single chest infection medication. In fact, he's going down anything but I'm too far. He's going down anything better. Get in there. And it's working. Okay, now. I want my feet and video lessons. I'm a fan of radio, but I'm a fan of radio, but I'm a fan of radio. I'm a fan of radio, but I'm a fan of radio. I can't believe that things are not seen. It's broken maybe every time I see him on the same as the same. But they can't deceive me. They can't deceive me. I'm quite the same. I'm quite the same as my other things. They can't deceive me. They cannot be. I try to tell them when they couldn't see me. They couldn't hate me. Yeah Yeah, she was a boy, so yeah It is Saturday. It is day before the show. We have just taken a first look at Lewis. Fastest first in the morning in a very very very good position. Okay. He's my father heavy Yes, he's ever been this boy and I'm both far probably the most condition he's been at this point. I think that it's in good very very good Just set up the day today with done three days as pretty much 1500 gram of carbs And we can come in the water day. We can back that off a little bit today. We can probably be a little less aggressive Because bonus is there pretty much it's just about holding it and just probably a little bit at the end of the day Which we'll do with backward fries, start a protocol It's just manipulation of water they will pull back a little bit on that and just for the spectators The boy in the food that goes in the boy with fluid that I think goes in I'll be just making sure the mid-section see the title of the week of tomorrow morning There's still a bit plenty in that and keep it in full. I don't even have a bit of cover I don't even have to play by the little bit and then going to tomorrow very fulfilling It will be a lot of more than two news in the morning that I'll be here. Good good day We are just chilling. Let's go to the next 30 of the leaves So we're going to go to the expo just before I'll have a look around Cut it with a few people, get back, chill, pose and eat burgers so we can't delay that This is all we find in our team Tanning Dunn, Lewis is starting to turn around and I'll like shade of my honking We are going to head back to the apartment, just chill, pose in between meals We've lowered Lewis's last few meals just before he goes in for burgers tonight He's going to be hungry for them Going to head over to the basketball court, full places It's a very close to the room for his routine He's just trying to cover times and he'll stick and he'll go in there I think it's just a matter of just 24 hours from now He should be over, so we shall see what tomorrow brings When give me the�il procedur Young good god works. His burgers is 20 pounds midnighthhhh, look at this his pink So, at this, at the sack, wake up full, absolutely pure. Right for the day, day will probably be just to have one bigish meal first thing and then to cruise into the show. It needs to be on roughly thinking around 12. One of lots of pretty much about 12 hours from now, so, good time to get this in now and pretty much lay off doing it and we'd nice them that empty. As we say, we'd say, we'd say, we'd say, nice and that, so you give, you see it. I only see the markets actually today, so, see it a bit.

Yes guys we are back is the last day here at the Dragons Lab before we head up to Reno the South of New. We've got a couple of hours to get session in and then we take off to the airport. Lewis is feeling a lot better than God. It was getting a little bit cut throughout whether he's going to make it or not. You've been really under the weather. Just trying to find that sort of like spark that is anything that was back up. These days we've got a push session lined up, moved some blood around nothing crazy. We're going to hit some good pose in, rounds, really see where we are because we started the load now. So 1500 grabs the car, just going in, putting them good use. So let's go get session in. We're going to get session in. We're going to get session in. We're going to get session in. We're going to get session in. We're going to get session in. That's a good sign. What we're doing at the moment, just literally 60-70% of Lewis is low. It's moving some blood around a couple of doubts. I'm going to try that and we're going to try and let them just try and keep the fullness in there. When we go and pose, it's a good sign of how full Lewis is. When we can see that, hum, it's a good market to see how much. Well, how well the food is going. How well it's holding on its unique. The impression. Let me out to drive what I came back. What you got to know we don't play that. What you got to know we don't play that. I've been laying low, I had to stay back. Can't check me now, you can't check me. You know I've been that boy was born lefty. Crunch times about how you move on your tire. But the careful pun if you're on a fire, because you don't want it's got to go. Let by Honda decisions you chose. Peaks feel good, but those values get low. Chains for the tires and the rain, hell snow. It's like that everywhere that you go, everywhere that you. A lot of motherfuckers go down, don't come up. Voicing your head, don't shut up. Loing up between the D, you try to call back, but she hung up. Anything that try to get the one up, run out. Solling to pen it, the fence back in it. Real love, the same for the fame, a bad way to shit. I'm trying to move around to get depressed in that home. Life been hidden like some rest is the loan. It's been a rock you week. Brainwork, I use my heart in a while. Gotta get the fence bouncing off the audio files. I got away and know my sentence, like they caught in a trout. Why you ain't no kid caught in denial? Yeah, I remember y'all. Let me out to drive what I came back. Boy, you gotta know it on play that. Boy, you gotta know it on play that. I've been laying low at the same bed. I was at work, they did not die. No magic button on life, ain't no tie-dives. Go, gotta out. The flow so, flow, try to. Three pack of serving them all, all all out. Live behind decisions I chose. Peaks feel good in the values get low. Chains for the tires and the rain, hills, snow. It's like the everywhere that I go, everywhere that I go. Hey. Just let me out. Hey. Oh. Oh. Oh. Yeah. Come on. Say, when? Yep. Fuck it out. Oh. That hurt. That's good, ain't no. Nice and light. Squeeze. Peace. That's it. Is there a wrap? We're done. And Vegas. Gonna take a look at Lewis now. Get some food in and eat for it to the airport. You know, he's going to be here. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. I'm sick. That was the first time you've been able to do that, oh yeah. Positive steps today. Just finished training at the had a good pump session. Six exercises, Lewis isn't too gas, which is good. Managed to then come in here and do a full round of poses without stopping. Which is literally the first time you've been able to do this on the US soil this time around. So, luckily, it's Wednesday today. We've got those before I leave Saturday into Sunday just to clear this and make sure everything is absolutely golden. Any good levels of rap, you see a much better in himself. Literally the last couple of days has been real tough. Just sort of trying to just get that mindset because as anyone knows, who's a competitor there, the desire to get on stage is there, but as soon as you are in where or if you're not feeding it, you know what I mean that's sort of then I guess motivation to get on stage drops and you feel shit. And trying to pick that back up is a hard task, but luckily today Lewis is working up in a very good position. It's for the equalised and the mentality going into the next few days he's feeling so much better about himself. So, very positive steps today. Big bonus. Hookup ups in the shaker. One up and see. The last one was ruined. I watched my last one last night and it's like, so, that's it. I'm sure that we said we could have done something. We got to accept it, but I could be stuck in America. It doesn't work here, but I'm getting a car and I know if it drives seven hours to arena. We'll see. All done at 4.55. What's the time now? 3.45. My passport. A little bit fun. It's what happens when you wash your passport. I'll see if it works. There's like a game room. The question. That's a hotel. Got a decent elevator. I can grab me up. You're a person, can't I? I was in a trunk in the balcony. I might get some luts. I'm not sure if you can get some luts. Yeah. We're in. We've got some for lunch. Nice. It's a little bit fun. So we've just woke up. The position that Lewis is in now is probably lack a little bit of fullness. We'll do not push that much food, but the condition that we're seeing at the moment is relative to where he's been at. Texas Tampa. Surely morning. This is crazy. It's very, very promising. Going into the next few days. He's just about to weigh himself. He won't look at it. I'll make sure. I see it just for some correlation to where we are. The starting point from this low, these pretty much two and a half kilos up from where we were at Texas. So that period where we have post show where we went quite aggressive. Suddenly, we were just paid off. So this new tissue there. It's going to bring some crazy new conditions. Well, the state's something that they're there to see in that this morning. I'm blown away. So positive. Positive. Please. So we're going to go and find the gym. There's a couple of gyms that are linked with the lead of festival. So we have a few meals in Lewis fast. Head to the gym. Never like just up a pump session. 67% of the news on the blood around is breathing now. It's so much better as well. Like we're on the sort of plus on the positive side of him returning back to full health. Which is not really bonus. In the medication these days, he managed to pose this morning without having to stop without having to. But catch his breath, which is a real real sort of landmark for us at this point. Go in in because like I said a few days ago, it was a little promising. So it's a good time. It's a good time. It's a very happy. What are you yesterday? Yeah. And finally mine. Yeah. You actually dropped a kilo to nine. Yeah. You went in perfect time to start. You were wondering why you went in nine days. Do you want to know what I'm doing? I don't know who I want to know what I am. One point six up. One point six up. Yeah. From your signal. Yeah. You were in a certain night. You were in a certain night. You were in a certain night. This is a very very good position to be. Even better. Even better position to be. No another food that we put in yesterday is stuck. Normally at this point we're just trying to hold the fullness. The weight is such as well because food just processed for 1500 grams of carbs. And yes, we've gone heavy on that in the past. 1600 on the first day. And we've seen a drop. But the condition today is the same that I expected to see. But I'm going to at least do the same or maybe a little lower but the food is held in this condition is pulled in. It's a broken bread. So it is the first session in Reno. We've located a gym. It's not far from here. So we're going to head there and let me know. It's just eaten again. Okay. With three meals deep. Everything's looking very good. I've just finished all the required food. But the helalics on stage last night was up to the very, very early hours. And the morning comes fantastic in China. It said PCA, a philic affiliated show in China. One of the biggest shows that you'll see at age up. Crazy Christmany. In his class, I think it was 18 dB placed second and then got moved into the overall. Where he then got stiff. I'll have 20 guys in a little bit of way they do it with loads of very strange. But I've got some good prize money. I've looked at absolutely incredible super super chef. He's doing the British PCA from the next week. So keeping my eye up for that, I've got a guy in Portugal competing this weekend. He's doing a regional. He's looking fantastic. So I'm just being there now. He's just updated me before he goes to bed before his final day before his load. We'll get back. I'll start on client plans. And then just watch Lewis expand, I guess. Monitor it. And then tomorrow is day three of the load. So we've done it a little bit differently this time. Because of the way that Lewis is feeling and the response that I know that we can get in the moment. Push in some food a day early. I think there's been much more beneficial to us. It puts us in a solid position going into the show where we're not chasing. I guess the manipulation of water, which can be quite harsh on the physique. And also the way that Lewis is feeling, just chucking a load of facts and carbohydrates in his body. Elevating that sort of energy level is certainly put him in a fantastic position now. So we'll see how things go. So we're here in Reno. We're in, I'm sorry, again, I haven't been able to do this. American iron. We're here in Reno. First session in American iron gym. Massage place. Massage place. Proper mix of pretty much just all the tools that we're going to start track. Some flex. I'm a strength. A little bit of prime. Perfect for what we want. Just moving through the food that we put in. Nurses. 3 days out now. So you just want to get a very careful couple of exercises pro muscle grip. Triple and back. Church, stelts. And one by one try. Nothing crazy. Getting in, get out. It's a nice little pose in room. So we're going to do some rounds in there. Nurses are going to practice with routine. It's been choreographed. But something more special. So excited to see all that come together. Let's come out. We're going to get the shit done. Let's all catch the leader. Rebels so child got a fist ball. I'm a pre-spon of ancestors and I'm blessed. They got knocked him, telling feds up. I can check stuff. Hell and care free. Not the skills. Me, hell and break. Yeah. I got next stuff. Right. No real love the same. Cause see when I look in your eyebrows. You not gated talking, I ready to ride. You do better eat than they cry. My pen is ignited. My soul is enlightened. I like who I can but I buy it. The palettes right on my trip. It's a fountain. I'm not like these regular guys. All that talk is my skyddit. What you like the way I make the tape print. But the ground make the world's play is grim. I'm the river between for the kids. Switz the label. I have to check like a blaze man. Something's barking where it's brain is. The beat is summer with it. Prancing. You're running away. I make the face jump in the passion. It's tasteless. They likely to run in my pool when they see face to face. They quick with the shape shit. I've done an egg with the gravest shit. By the front of the crème to the grave bitch. Big man how they face tense. Look both ways. If you catch fade I'm a nice guy. You're on the inside. Then I'm not somebody to be played with. Keep it on. I'll wake it up. I don't remember how to ground this. I like to see the oven brows. Try to wonder if they drown. I head on the swivel. Yeah. It's only really my surroundings. It keep it out of my guitars. I don't remember how to ground this. I like to see the oven brows. Try to wonder if they drown. I head on the swivel. Yeah. It's only really my surround. It can't stop. Won't stop. Tell that's what the world really glows track. Tell that they can do it. They're the stoves. I type of shit they hide in the tube. I just skip counting the new block. But I'm still around it. It could just not. Better hold it down with a group drop. I kick now for the crowd up a loop pop. They take them around for my moon. Better run them out of town for their hope fly. Queen Xi and Han like new line. They beat the host with a whip. They just not. They beat right up against the face. They beat against the gang. But it's just not. They beat the kick and they say. But they're subpar. If you enjoy through the club and the fly stop for life. I feel amazing. Damn it's keen. I've paid the angle. I send it to your girl but I make a face lift. This is your point. One more session to go. We'll be back here tomorrow. Last. Up a sun. Going up a looking there, it's now in the closing room. He's looking a bit swah. He should be. We might see these guys on. I'm not ready. So let's go in there. See what's under there. Yeah. The red sun rose this morning. Dark skies thrown out this morning. No way to right, no way to right. Hold on. The floor is gaving. Your wall's shining through cages. Your refuse will be your team right. That's the way to tell you. Your power is as special. We don't fit on your canvas. Holly, where are you? Is your job? Things you need. We'll be right there.

The whole event II brought the street to the final commercial, monitors aimed and So we have survived and helped with after a six hour journey. Or a rain and all of their experiences, but we made it, I didn't rush, I took it in flash and my wife. And yeah, this is not about really nice stories, again I've turned on, she went back in a second and I looked at her and she went back and it was time to be in there, I've got four more checkers to do, I did more jobs and checking for the next, but both seas, people check and stuff. Japanese, so we get them done up way and then do a lot of checkers for them to know how I used to say, she looks like her dad, so she's a kind of fantastic, nice big help us, we need to see her in the footage, my current time. So, what's that? Those are scum moves, I think. Do you know the keeny ready? That's why it's been a good chance. Yeah, yeah, I did. No, once you ever look at you, yeah, I've put my other bit in some of those. Because you just had your time to want to do a rub or make marks, anything loose, like five pounds, long enough, I mean. Yeah, okay, yeah, okay. Do you have your license? Yeah, there is, you don't have a stick to yourself. We're in the jam, yeah, but you know about making marks as you can. I've got my license. I feel like I've got this. Check it out. I'm not on the camera. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, the whole time is just a slide. I don't want to do it like I said before. I need these names, Federation and PCA, like really mean, tight and dry condition. If we put too many carbs in the gym, then we'll do it. Okay. Yeah, I don't want to do it like I said before, you need these names, Federation and PCA, like really mean, tight and dry condition. If we put too many carbs in the gym, then we'll lose that in the flesh of the diesel. Yeah, so your side points really tighten on me as well. So we want to keep that in that situation. Okay, so hopefully proteins and fats. Okay. So fats whole fullness. Yeah. Push the carbs in today. They're sitting there and you haven't been even in a little bit like, Yeah. Yeah. It'd be a big pump out of the really push that glyphogen in. Okay. Maybe sat there and I'll weigh it at the pump up. I love it, so we need some zip-force names. Okay. So make sure we get it, let's hop up. Yeah. And we need to be really happy and say well, that's good seeing you in the flesh of the... Yeah. Nice. Yes. Excited. I can't believe you. You happy? I'm happy. Let's say you passed up tonight. Stay calm and be fresh in the night. Just a minute, people. You see they look in dry and they look in red. And it's literally what my mouth is like, I love it. I'll be at it. It's a fattened smile. It's trickler-in because you're on too far. So again, you don't push too much in over the day. Because you're on a hog water. Yeah. So that's why I like to get a move. So on of your frame, the seat, do you think that's a fattening day? I'll sort of complete later. I can help you a bit. She's ever been. Oh. Well, that's a guess, man. Good. Yeah. I'll see you, stupid. Yeah. It's time then. I'm the kind of fellow person. It was somebody towards the end. Whereas this time it's like, I'm not going to be this close type thing. Yeah. You're my car. Yeah. You're the only one. Yeah. It is a mind build at the end because you've been doing so much fat. That's probably so excited. Not too many. Not too many. Lie down and so in cars. Yeah. But they're hell. But they're all in need. You're going to have better future. Morning. Morning. Morning. Are you feeling fine? Yeah. You're sleeping, don't you? Yeah. What are you doing? Yeah. It's very long. It's been a long time. It's all the food. Yeah, maybe. Yeah. You know, just find that.

And the party's just in the last weekend. It's what's at it on the phone. I have a wonderful one on the show. I think it's about 12 in our room for our tea. We're about to go to school. I should either get in a town, make up hair. So I'll wear a set of my own suits. You'll see when there's more of them. We're the one. Absolutely insane. You're going to do so well. I just need to feel it on my bones. So can I get out and ride to the mountains? Trust me. Um, sweet, don't really get you again?

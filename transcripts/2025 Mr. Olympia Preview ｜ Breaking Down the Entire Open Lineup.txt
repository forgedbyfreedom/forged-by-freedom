 What's up guys welcome back to Bloods Wet and Geore with Coaches. Skip Hill, Andrew Berry, I'm Scott McNally and all of our programming is brought to you by you. Yeah you, the people of Patreon, thank you guys very much for your support. We're brought to you by truenutrition.com. Use our code thinkover there. SupplementSource.ca for Canadians. Alright, so listen, Andrew stitched together for us in a macular piece of art actually. This is you literally put together pictures of everybody who is qualified for the Olympia and you listed how they got qualified. I list are I listed there the last time we saw them on stage. Oh, that's what it is. So the picture is from the last appearance we saw of them on stage. How are we going to say? How come I mean, come on. Well, I actually first asked chat GPT to do it for me. Oh, it's not. It's not. And it responded. Yeah, but it responded saying it couldn't. So then I actually had to do it myself. The only person that's not in these groupings is Beirut because he will not be my understanding is he's not able to come and get a visa in the United States being from Iran. So he's the only one and where you can talk about where he would shake things up in this mix. But I organized it into tears and I love it. Yeah, I organized in a sense of like based off of, okay, where did you place in the most recent Olympia? What has been and obviously Nick didn't do the Olympia the last two years, but what has been your trajectory in the most recent shows and what has been your MO in the Olympias you have been a part of. So this is my top six or at least the grouping that I'm considering. The guys we should talk about in the top six. Samson, Hathi, Derek, all Olympia champions themselves. Nick, he won the New York Pro this year. Martin, he got fourth in a breakout year last year at the Mr. Olympia. And then I guess I'm going to say like the mystery dark horse Andrew Jack, who if he could just dial it all in and get really conditioned, he might be able to pull all these guys away, you know structurally and it's crazy because he goes to our gym now and it's kind of cool in the times I do get to go to see him training a little bit. But I don't know, it's one of these things where we don't really know what these guys are looking like right now because none of them are posting any pictures. Yeah, you know, two, three or three and a half weeks out. So I will say that Samson had that really nice guest posing at six weeks out. People can just look that up on Google. He was in great condition for six weeks out. Yeah. Hathi is, we know he's going to be in condition. So he's going to make it. We know he's we know he's he's going to be able to make it over. My understanding is that he signs an employment contract with Evagin every year and so he gets in on a work visa and because he's been doing that several years in a row, he gets preferential clearance, I guess. Trusted traveler. Yeah, exactly, exactly. But what do you guys like out of this mix? I'll say this man. I would love to see Andrew Jack step up. You mentioned that, you know, if you were to bring it in, I feel like he still needs a little bit more size, honestly, when I've seen him, but I'm going by seeing him in the past. I felt like he needed more. Maybe he's brought it up. You mentioned Samson and that that recent guest posing or recent appearance. I think that his conditioning there says that he is on track to be his best. If Samson comes in, absolutely fricking head to toes diced with the fullness, the roundness, all of that. I don't think that anybody is going to be able to beat that. He's just absolutely the prettiest. But you know what man, that's like the day all these guys really, let me say this, all of these guys in their place, it's going to come down to how they nail their peak. It's not like any of them are that much better than the others. You know, I mean, maybe just what I know of, I would say if I were to take this a tear further, I would call it Samson, hotty, Derek and Nick. That's if I were to like try to, try to boil it down further, boiling it down further from there. I don't know, man. Tell me, what do you guys hear about Derek lately? Because I haven't heard a lot. Like, you know, like people are talking about Nick, people are talking about this guy, people are talking about that guy. We saw Samson. Like, I feel like Derek's quiet, but maybe it's just the social media that I've been seeing. Um, I mean, he did just open his gym three weeks ago. So to the public. So who knows, there might be the added stress of that. But um, I mean, I don't know. I don't know how he's going to look. I haven't seen him lately. Now, I used to see him in my 40 all the time. I'm not really sure. I will say this that if gun to my head, like, who do I think is going to bring their best look, but without a long, without a doubt, uh, Nick Walker. And just seeing his motivation talking to him, um, you know, I'm good friends with Kyle's coach and, you know, I did get to see some exclusive picks. All right. Recently, Nick is far and above. He was ahead of schedule when I saw these picks and he was a lot bigger than he had been. Earlier this year in a good way. So, um, I think this could be the, if he nails his peak of him and Kyle nail it, I think this could be his year where he becomes Mr. Olympia. And he believes he can. Nick has never had the, uh, at Nick's had momentum going into other shows before. This isn't the first time that people have gotten behind him. But I would say I have never seen people get behind Nick Walker. Like I have this year. And I think that he believes in himself more than he ever has to. I agree. I'm with you guys as far as I, but I'm going to switch one. I don't know if it's because I, well, I've been in the sport a long time. So I fancy myself as someone who can put aside biases and, you know, either friendships or the fact that it's my client, you know, or something, something along those lines. I'm pretty good at that. Andrew and I have talked about that in the past. I have Samson, Hottie and Nick in top. I want to believe. And I think Nick should be able to beat Derek. Now this is where the, I don't know if it's necessarily a bias, but it's, uh, it's something that I look at. I don't like Derek. Derek's got a great physique. So before the Derek minions crawl down my throat and up my pants and everything else. He's got a great physique. I don't like that. I don't like the conditioning. I don't like the, what people are finally starting to talk about the, the volume, but the lack of separation. If we just look at Nick's arms, no one is going to win the Olympian arms. I'm just making a point. If you look at Nick's arms and you look at Derek's arms, there's right there too. There's a lot going on in the last and stuff that I think that could take the, um, you know, take away from the conditioning too. But look, let me compare Derek's condition to like Victor Martinez. That's what I see when I see that physique. To me, this is just me. He's riding on structure and shape more than he is conditioning. Because if you break that conditioning down, it's not that it's bad, but it's not dry and hard. Hotty hard dry. It's, it's, it's maybe, he looks great. It's a little, it's maybe a different type of condition, but take, take this for what it's worth. Yeah. Take this for what it's worth seeing Derek at the Arnold and like having pretty good seats. I, I can say this. I don't think that I have ever seen a better body builder in person in my life. The peak that he nailed there. It was the most awestracking. And I'm not saying that as like, oh man, I'm rooting for him. But just like trying to be objective, I was like holy crap. The condition. He brought there. Yeah, there was a wild factor in the condition was part of it, man. I hadn't seen anything like it was one of the best looks. If not, like it's right up there. I can't think of anybody else that, I mean, there's other guys that had different wild factors. I'll say I'll leave it at this. One of the absolute best physics I had ever seen in my life. That specific peak in person. Where are you now? There's no doubt and Derek has a beautiful physique, right? And I think what Skip is referring to though is he's conditioned in certain, like his glutes and hamstrings are completely dialed in. But from the front, we're just not seeing the same kind of action in the upper chest, the deltoids, even the lats. Whereas you look at a competitor like Haudi and Nick who are probably going to be the most conditioned guys in the show. Those guys have detail that just crawls out of every crevice. Lines everywhere. No stone unturned in terms of conditioning. So it's just different physics, right? And then Samson's kind of in the middle of those, of those different groups. He's got a beautiful physique. He gets pretty good condition. But again, I don't know if it's lighting because I've never walked away from a show being like, wow, Samson was peeled. Even when the Olympia, I didn't think that it was like that crazy, you know, 100%. But you know what, man, I can think of other guys that had were pretty like, uh, brain and curry. When he, and that he said that that was his favorite look. The year he won the Olympia. I liked him at the Arnold better when he was more peeled than that, you know, but it, yeah. And that's why, you know, it's a subjective sport, right? It's, yeah. And I say that by the way about Derek, like not saying like, oh man, I'm rooting for him. You guys, you know, like, I'm, I'm just saying like, that's my, like, as objective as I can be, like holy crap. I wish you guys could have seen that right there. But you know, you're right because when I think of what I was looking at, it's like the side shots where you can see how etched out the glute and the hamstring was and all that, you know what I mean? It was, but not in the, yeah, I know that you're right. The chest has been though the, the flaw hasn't it? I've never seen, I don't think I've seen Derek on stage. But having seen like Nick on stage at both the Arnold Classics several years ago, and then at the New York this year, that's kind of how I felt, the way you're describing, Scott, of like, this is one of the greatest physiques that's ever walked on stage. In terms of nailing a peak conditioning, maximizing muscle tissue per, you know, square inch on the body. And that's not to say that every single athlete up here does have some flaws. Scott, I did just send you a picture just a minute ago of hottie that I do want to show here, because he is the one guy that showed a picture of most of his physique in a time frame that I think we should probably show. I did reach out to Nick. I'd reach out to Derek a couple weeks ago. He was supposed to be on my podcast and he canceled on us or he just no showed us. So I wasn't going to reach out for pictures from him. Yeah, I don't know what happened there, but can I make a comparison while you're doing that? Yes. Oh, sorry. I was pulling the other one. No, that's okay. I know I'll change. I thought it would take longer. I'll go back, I'll go back to it in a second. Here's that picture. So that was him a seven and a half weeks out. I think the man's going to be in shape. Yeah. Yeah, look at that thickness. Yeah. And on, I just watched a video of him. I think it was three days ago. He was shrugging. I think it was seven or eight plates aside. Of course he was. I mean, and we've all seen the squat videos with him squatting five plates for 10 reps, you know, back squats, no smith machine regular back squats and doing lunges with 315. So if there's ever a guy a poster child for you better not lose strength during prep, hot is your guy. Yeah. Yeah. So let me ask you if you guys see this or not. And it just might be the way my brain works. It's a little off. But it's almost like he takes Samson and maybe he's the 2024 2025 flex wheeler. The Negro over to hottie and you see a 24 25 Sean Ray. And then when I say this, with more muscle, that's why I'm saying 2024, 2025. And then when I look at Derek, I think of an arguably better or in this generation, Jay Cutler. That's not bad. Okay. Fair enough. I just didn't know if I was looking at it kind of skewed. It's like if you totally see that. I can totally see that. And you added more size. We have similar looks and the Jay Cutler Derek comparison is again because of conditioning. Jay was always in condition, but it wasn't the right condition. Beal exactly. Exactly. But here's the thing though, Jay did reach that conditioning in his first Olympia. Fair enough. Yeah. That was my, that was literally my favorite, my favorite look at Jay Cutler was that and yes, he didn't have the same size that he had when he eventually started winning them. But the peak that the him and Chris aceto had, that one blew my mind, you know, detail everywhere. But but only Oh, go ahead. Go ahead. I'll just say my only criticism I guess of Nick and God do I hate to create like give any type of constructive criticism when someone says he can so much far and above what I've ever accomplished. But so take it, you know, for what it's worth. But I find that the three on top aesthetically are more pleasing to my eye if I were a judge than Nick. And that says a lot, I think, because I genuinely like Nick. I like everything about the guy. I love the drive. I love the support system he's got in place. He's a good dude. But I don't that's the only thing that makes me go, sure, even his best may not be able to pull it up. But I'm going to, I'll be the first one to be jumping out of my chair. If he can pull this off and be like, you know, FES, this is freaking awesome. I would agree if you skip if we didn't see him at the Pittsburgh next to in and Martin pushing. And I don't think the complaint, I don't think there were any complaints of like, he looks a little wonky or his structure is not as good as today. It was really a, do you think Derek one or do you think Nick one? You know, yeah. And you make that's a very good point. But let's go now. This is this is me playing the other side. Let's go to into the judges head for a minute. Did Derek win because they thought that quite possible. I mean, I don't know. Obviously, it's a guess, but that's when I, it's that's like, and when you get to this level, it's got to be really hard to judge because it's not apples and oranges, but it's very, like for our as a Lamborghini's. It's like, what is your pret like it's like, how do you do this? It's not like, well, he looks so much better from the front. No, yeah, they're all so close. So much better. And that's why I'm saying skip. I think it's going to come down to a lot of it is going to be their peak. You know, like who nails it, you know, who nails it and he does it. We always expect like anytime we do these predictions, we're assuming everybody comes in exactly how they want to come in, right? Right. There are best, they're best in our head. Yeah. So of those would say those four, who is more likely, just your opinion, who is more likely to not come in peaked, not more likely, but who's less likely to come in peaked? Like I would say sand can gambling because it's not it's not 100% usually. I would say Samson and Derek. That's what I'm saying statistically. I think you're saying thing. Yeah. I mean, Haudi has, you can argue and say he was a half percent off at the last Olympia. Maybe he's a little bit off. Not really, but you know, maybe it's just because Samson with better than he did the year before. But Nick and Haudi seem to nail their peaks. I think their coaches are very good at manipulating water. They're very good at knowing exactly how much to fill them up before it starts to crowd separation. Yeah, I think they're they're the odds on favor to nail their peaks. I think that Derek will have a better probability this year working with the Cedo. I think that they've gotten to learn his body a lot more now. And I so I could see him statistically doing better with Chris. Now with Samson and here's the thing. I feel like anytime you critique the champ and maybe it's just Samson but people get really defensive. His wife isn't somebody who has peaked a ton of people over the decades. So statistically, I don't think it's been done as many times with him. So I think that that in itself could be a potential place. That said, it's not like she's dealing with anybody else. She's seeing him literally every freaking day. That's what I was going to say. So it could be how many times does she peaked in? It could be an advantage. Yeah, did you mean where she making the calls like, hey babe, actually you should do this regardless of what coach was saying? And right, it might have worked out. I mean, yeah, there's that. I mean, I'll give you a quick one. Years ago, I don't remember, I think it was either universe or I don't know. But John Meadows, he was like, last grade, what she thinks. Post her and let me know what she says. Because he's like, she looks at you every day. She's the one taking your pictures. Are you dry or you not dry? The lighting's not great. Reliant someone that sees you regularly. But before we go off the next slide, we haven't talked about Martin much. I think that's because Martin reached a new pinnacle last year. And then I think we yeah, maybe all collectively thought there's a little bit of a let down this year. He didn't necessarily move forward or he didn't necessarily achieve that same Olympia peak. And because you know, that got me thinking about it when we're talking about who's likely to nail or not nail their peak. And we've seen some up and down with Martin over the last, you know, 2018 months. So, um, do you guys think Martin stays on the top four or five? I think that no matter what, it's going to be really tough. And for me to answer that question, I want to see the next grouping too. Because some of those guys could be part of was, you know, push him. Before you pull that up, I'll go out, I'll go on the record and say I don't see them at top four. I could see him potentially pulling the fist spot. But I do not just by opinion, I don't see him. Hey, I've been wrong before the viewers have pointed out that I was wrong before. Hey, the right peak. So the right peak on him and the wrong peak on somebody else could change everything. No question. Well, the upside for him is just huge, right? I mean, the potential is all there. So, yeah, I agree. Before we did move on to the next grouping, though, I did want to, I want to throw this out there. Just one of our listeners, Dane said he's going to call Samson, Nick, Hottie, and if he makes it, oh, Hottie, if he makes it and then Derek and then Martin. And I wanted to also ask what do you guys think at home? You guys comment, let us know. And I'm going to add to that right now, I feel like you guys tell me if you've noticed this bodybuilding fans, I think are more passionate than they've ever been. Like, ever. You hear people arguing more now. Like, I don't remember people arguing like, I hate you basically. If I think that's just social media and John, maybe that's it. I can't disagree with you, but I think it runs across the gamut. Well, you're right, Dosecott, because there's so many bodybuilding podcasts, there's so many bodybuilding specific pages that fans from all over the place can go and argue about their favorite guy. Or, you know, it's funny because I read one where someone was trying to say, like, Nick's legs were shit. And I'm like, okay, wait, shit, like, come on. Like, shit is like the guy who plays fourth place at the local show. You know, he doesn't have legs. But to say something like, Nick's legs are shits, like, come on. All right, this is the next year. And these are guys that, I mean, what I'm really excited about, to see how he does against these other guys is earth. You know, he just want to show his back to back. He put on something like 30 pounds from his classic cutoff to what you see on stage in this picture. And I want to say the first show he did, I felt like while he was deserving to win, they overcarved the shit out of him. And he just began the separation. And then I think they learned for the second show last week, where he brought much better balance in terms of separation and dryness and fullness. So I mean, I actually have a bet with one of my, one of my buddies on where he's going to place. I won't say it out loud on this podcast, but let's just say I have him a lot higher than I think a lot of people do. What do you guys think? I'm speaking for myself once he gets out of the top five. It's a roll of dust. I mean, because it's just man, there, well, it is because there's also not that predictability as the, as we move to like through tears, we're also moving into, I don't want to say lack of consistency, but not the consistency of knowing how they're going to show up. So it makes it easier for me to say, you know, or us to say, well, we know how hot he's going to show up. It's going to be pretty damn close to what we're thinking about in our head, arguably with Nick too. Okay, and maybe it'll depend if Derek is, you know, drying off or tight enough, same with Samson. But when you get down into the next year, then it's, to me, it's kind of a roll of the dice. I mean, it's going to, again, coming down to the peak. I think that top four, top five, I think the top four is, unless there's just a shocking, oh my god, type of thing. I don't see the top four changing, but that's just, study show creatin doesn't just fuel your muscles, it fuels your brain. Research links creatin to improved memory, focused, and mental clarity, especially while under stress. It helps reduce mental fatigue, supports learning, and may even protect long-term brain health. I order my creatin from true nutrition, use code think and check out to get 10% off and support this podcast. Power your body and your mind with true nutrition creatin. By the way, this is my actual morning routine, mixing 15 grams of creatin into my oats, no flavor, no texture, and hey, since I got married, we store it in this fancy jar, so it doesn't look like my wife lives with a bro. But hey, if you're single, just leave it in the bag on the counter. It's totally fine. Okay, well, let's take it this direction because we've got some of the old guard in this grouping between, I almost said, sedra, between Brandon Curry, Akim Williams, and Edward. So what do we think they're going to continue sliding? I say yes. Yeah, I'm not saying I want that, but I would say yes. Unless we see a Gunter Schler camp, you know, someone show up all of a sudden that is just like, oh crap. You know, it goes from 10th to second, or I don't know what the what the placing was. I've got too many shows in my brain for too many years, for point being, unless it's just something extraordinary there. I don't see anybody in this tier being catapulted up and being kind of a shocking like, wow, he killed it. But I will counter that because I think the one guy that could really crack in to maybe break some hearts in the top five would be good veto. I was waiting. Sorry, man, you go ahead. No, no, no, no, take it, dude. You keep going. I was going to because I was just going to turn it to you and ask what did you think of good veto because you kind of lead knew in that direction. Yeah, so we didn't get to see him on stage for the Pittsburgh show and he was training at MI40. So it was kind of cool to see him do some posing and whatnot. He's got an exceptional physique and the guy knows how to get peaked. I don't know who his coach is, but I think I don't know what's a Cedo. Sorry. Yeah, and yeah, he won the, what did I say? The Arnold Brazil, right? Yeah, and I looked at those pictures up because there's so many pro shows now that aren't necessarily in the US that you forget that there's so many great physiques and so many great guys that win some of these shows. He's got a physique that if it's not this year that he's cracking into the top six, I think it's very, very soon he will be. He's his leg separation size, muscular development. His legs are crazy, man. Yeah, he's got ridiculous leg. If there's anything I'd like to see a little bit more thickness in the lats. And again, like Skipsed, picking apart guys that are eons better than you. Yeah, you know, and I do want to point out actually after I put this together, I did find out Raphael is out of the Olympia. Okay, he won't be competing. And I guess like an idiot, I put Sassana up there twice. I noticed that. I always think I'm going to call you out. It's just giving a better odds, you know, but I want to point out about Soss is I don't know what kind of physique we're going to get out of them because he competed I think five shows earlier this year. I mean, betray Detroit, Dubai, New York. He did. I can't remember if he did Pittsburgh or not. He did Toronto. He kept five or six and he kept coming up against like almost getting it, almost getting it, you know, trying to get the qualification until he did. I thought he looked phenomenal at Detroit, like, like between him and Barnack. I thought they both looked incredible. And you know, and deserving to be in this realm. But are you thinking that maybe he's not going to be able to hold what he had earlier on? Well, I mean, I've never competed in seven shows in a season. So I don't know what it's like. But again, I'm not a professional in the level these guys are, right? So maybe he has just structured his health phases, his lifestyle with stress and everything that as soon as he got done competing earlier in the year, he really destressed, got his adrenals figured out and maybe made a little bit more progress. I mean, who knows? This could be his best show ever. I don't know. I think one thing he did show is that a guy like him can take two years off from the stage and come back and hang with most of the best of them and win shows and be in the top three and what four or five shows. So yeah. And here's the thing that I've kind of noticed about Sassan because I knew him from, you know, back before he had always been and I really see it now. I don't think that he's got to push super hard with the supplements to be able to get where he's at. I don't think that he's been redlining it. And I think that that is, you know, obviously going to work on his side to be able to continue doing it. What's the name is beating myself up over here? The 2025 Europa? What's his? Erskinsky. Okay. Of all the physics up there because I just could not get it. Of all the physics up there as far as just pleasing, like if I said, if God came down and said, you have to choose someone's skip to change physics with I'd want that physique more than any other physics up there. To me, it's, and I understand I, you know, I see, yeah, his arms can be bigger, you know, things like that. But that shape to me, I just look at something like that and they go, so if I was going to play favorites, I'd say, man, I just, I really want to translate as well. Do well. But with more. I know. He's the governor. Yeah. For the last six, seven years. Good. Good look. So that one's kind of I want to say it's up for grabs. But who knows how that's going to play out? I mean, I want to see Dorian in the mix only because he has turned a corner just to see where are you going to stack up against these other guys with having turned that corner and now your condition isn't a place that it hasn't been before. So it's there's going to be some fun in there for the first. I think hers has room, you know, to to what you're saying, Andrew, both of you guys, he's got room. Like I'm excited. I think we're all excited to see, you know, what he does in the next couple of years. The knock on earth is his back. You know, he it's not wide enough yet from the back and it doesn't have the detail and the tissue coming out at you, you know, from from the backside. So and some of that could have been peaking, you know, maybe he just wasn't dry enough in the back area in some of these shows. But I think for him to catapult as a regular, say top six or first call out at the Olympia guy, he's got a real he's probably got another 15 to 20 pounds of muscle he's got to put on to really, you know, being that mix. But with that said, I got a question for you guys out of this group. Who do you think places highest? I think that Bonic has traditionally shown a real I could see I could see Bonic doing I wouldn't be put it this way. I wouldn't be surprised if Bonic did I know that's not a solid answer. I wouldn't be surprised if Bonic. He's got the experience. I know that he's older at this point, but I think he's just going to nail it. Although I could I could see ears pushing him out from it and Brandon, man, I don't think that I don't think we're going to see anything less from Brandon than we have in the past. So yeah, I do. I think, I mean, we all know Father time is undefeated and I think we've seen his waist slip a little bit more. You know, that's pretty physique that won him the Olympia. Sure. Not the exact same physique. While he might be able to get a little bit drier and a little bit more condition than he has in the past, I think he's losing a little bit of that bubbliness. But in that being said, I mean, all respect and hats off to him for still doing this after so many years. And he's got nothing left to prove in the whole game of bodybuilding. And he obviously loves the sport that much to continue doing this. So I'm happy to see him up there. But I would agree. I still think Bonic might be the guy because somehow he I can see Bonic and Earth's both. Would you put ears up there with me? I think Bonic Earth's in good veto. I think those are the three to watch out of this group. And I don't know exactly. I can't say where they're going to go. But I think. And then I put I think you're right. And I maybe put Brandon somewhere right after that. He's what's that? Oh, Brandon, Brandon. Yeah, yeah. I put Brandon right after that. Then if that's if that's where you're going, personally, yeah, I just think he still has enough. I still you know, still has enough. Let me answer you guys a question. When when competitors start to slip, let's say it's, you know, it's not just slip one year. It's, you know, it's a few years. How many of those competitors come in that? And obviously we don't have the answer, you know, an accurate answer. But off the top of your head, how many of those competitors actually show up and have a while, not just the wild factor, but they also place higher. And the place higher is important because I'm going to say come off the top of my head. It is, you know, one out of 300. I mean, it's it doesn't typically have once the slide starts and it shows any resembles of consistency. There's really not the only one that I can think of really. And I mentioned it earlier, it was was going to. That's the only one that I think that I can remember that I went, wait, wait, what? Like when I heard it, I went what? And immediately went to try to find what the information I could to see what, like how did this happen? I can't think of of of anybody else. Yes, they may lose the title, come back and get the title. But after a few years, when that slide starts to happen, it doesn't reverse itself. And if it does, it's incredibly rare. I even asked the viewers, like throw it at me, you know, bust me on this one. Who has done that? Who has reversed it and went, like, oh, shit, and had people go, oh crap, this is similar, but not exactly what you're talking about. But I consider what Sean Rodin did, winning the Olympia kind of like that because he was kind of always tight cast it into the second, third place guy. And then we saw all the pictures of him at the Pittsburgh Pro before it was a bodybuilding show when it was just an exhibition. Oh, yeah. And we were all like, oh, this guy's going to fall to like seventh, eighth, tenth at the Olympia. Like he's so out of shape, he lost so much muscle, he looks, he looks like a muscular guy with tits, you know, I mean, I remember looking at me and like, wow, and then everybody just saw him as like being like not laxidaisical. Remember that? Yeah. And then you just realized, no, he's just a calm, collected, internally kind of brooding kind of guy. And he'd been holding on to that that that that tasted back up his mouth of Phil Heath for a number of years. And he put it all together, man. Like, even he couldn't even remember he couldn't eat food. He was drinking out of a straw because his mouth was wire shut. And so I don't know, maybe, maybe we see, maybe I'm wrong. And maybe Brandon proves me in skip. Yeah. And I'm not saying it can't happen. All I'm saying is when does it not very likely based on, you know, all we remember when Arnold came back in one of the people. Exactly. When they gifted it to him. All right. Yeah, I could see I'm with you guys on all that. And listeners at home, what did you guys think of that round? Where did you guys put those people? And we've got our next grouping here. We just had Brett on the podcast this week. I'm expecting him to be to do a lot personally. You know, I feel like we haven't seen him for a year. Nobody's talking about him because of that. I think that he's definitely growing a lot since then. He had the gut issues. He pulled out of 23 and came back. It was like a year ago then that he competed at Legion. And yeah, we haven't seen him since. So I think 24, he was like just getting his feet wet again. You know what I'm saying at Legion. And now he's taking all of this time and him and Martin had been training. He's, you know, placing my heart for him. I want to see him like jump forward at the top to the top of this, you know, let me also say this grouping. I consider these guys that A, I didn't, it's kind of a mix guys that I didn't think we're going to be in the mix with guys that are wild cards. And I consider Brett, Tonyo and Jordan Hutchinson wild cards to where, yeah, I need to see him next to the other guys on stage before, you know, obviously. But it's like I couldn't in my mind. So I'd be like, man, is he a top 10 guy? Is he top five guy? Is he a top 50? You know, I, I will say this, you know, I think I can't remember his name. I'll talk my head. The Chinese man. He won the China Pro. He looks incredible. Unbelievable. Brown physique, but conditioning, if he brings the same conditioning, he brought to that show, he will finish last or dead last or second last. Yeah, his shape is crazy, man. Oh, he was, he was, he was over full, you know, incredible. Like his posing routine. Everything was bursting, but he turned around from the back and there wasn't a glute line, you know, which that wouldn't fly over here. Rubio, Nexilla, I just don't like his physique. I think it's wonky. I think and maybe it's just because his head is kind of small compared to his physique. I don't know, but it's like it just doesn't flow the way I want to see it, I guess. And then Dorian, I could see him out muscling people though. Like I could see him, you know, really pushing forward because I think too when he gets in, I think that's a very exposing pose. We have him in that front double bicep, but get him in like a side chest and he starts stomping people, you know, what I'm saying? When he can start, I, yeah, I did go on NPC news. And if they didn't have a front double from their last show, I just picked the next shot that they had. So most of these guys are in front doubles. For Dorian, I picked his best pose because I think his most most skill is pretty nasty when you see it on stage. Yeah, I agree. I think for Dorian, just the genetic caliber that he's going up against, he's going to be in that later call out, even if he reaches his best condition of all time, which that's not a knock on him. He's, he's done his career. He's done, he's put on a hell of a ton of muscle. He's reached his best conditioning recently. And he's continued bodybuilding all the way through. It's just when you run up to a wall, yeah, you're running up against a wall of genetic talent at the Olympia. It's, it's, you know, you've done what you've done. You've done what you can do, you know, can I add to that just real quick? In 2010, I competed against him at the Rocky Mountain. Yeah. And he was natural. And I was on a lot of drugs. And I couldn't date him. So there's that. And that's me really just kind of putting myself out there just going, yeah, he's pretty good. And I do suck. So, you know, I'm feeding the trolls probably. But that, a lot of people don't know. I mean, he started off his career. It doesn't matter when it comes to where you're going to place at the Olympia. I'm just making the point that he's one of those guys, much like a Phil Heath, who started out with either being natural or very, very low gear use. And I don't know during enough, well enough these days because I'm no longer in Colorado to know, you know, what he has done since I've left. I've been gone for quite a while, seven or eight years now. So I just want to see him standing next to people. And I think, yeah, I think you guys would agree. If he were to make the top 10, I think he would just be, oh, that'd be cool. Beside himself. Like, oh, shit. You know, like, wow. So. And I think a lot of us would who know him and, you know, see the go up and obviously his fans, but I like a lot of these guys. Yeah, that person. I kind of have that personal connection to him. So I would love to see that. There's a lot of these guys that I would love to see. I mean, I personally, I could see, I could see Quadzilla jumping forward. I could see him getting six, seven, even. I could see. I could see. I could see it. I'll make a bet on that one. I'll be right now. I could see Brett jumping forward. I could see him six, seven. You know, I Brett Nailin, a peak. I could see Jordan jumping forward. I could see him hitting the six, seven. Like, I just, I think it's going to be, like, I don't know. I really don't know until until we see it. But like, these guys to me are very exciting because I can't predict it. I can't call it man. I just can't. To me, the best dark horse or the, I guess, the, yeah, the best dark horse, I would say is Jordan Hutchinson here. And I'm biased. I saw him twice in person, beating a very good Quentin, in back-to-back weeks, as well as a couple of Joe. I can't remember his name. The one that skipped shit all over. I'm just kidding. But no, Jordan is huge on stage. I mean, he looks like he's 285 on stage. Yeah. And I don't know if he's, he might be 265, 270. I can ask Chris, but how tall is he? He's probably 5, 10 to 5, 11. So look a little on this taller side there. Okay. Yeah. But, you know, but he, but he, like, if you look, he doesn't have like the linkier arms. He's going to make some nice develop arms and every muscles in good proportion. And honestly, I think he still has more upside. I think he could probably fit like another 10 more pounds on that physique. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, he's just a nice guy too, which is always nice when, when, you know, guys that are doing well are nice people too. So, yeah. Big shout out to Jordan. He's, he's, he's a pretty cool dude. Both him and Brett both. I want to see them both. I'll, I'll tell you what, I'll, I'll take you on a bet. I want to see, I think that Brett is my dark horse. So if you've got Jordan as yours, we'll see. Let's see who, you know, and who knows about placings, right? But who's higher? Yeah. Right. Who places higher? Who's more the surprise? How about that? Yeah. That'd be a very happy for either one of these gentlemen. Right. If they did because I know Brett's a great person too. And, um, yeah. I mean, just nice following his career over the years. He, it'd be nice to see him back on stages here. So, yeah. Yeah. I think this is freaking amazing. Let me, uh, let me turn it to the audience again. Guys, what do you think? What do you think? Tell us, tell us where did we go wrong? Tell us what we should have done instead. And also tell us, did we miss anything? You know, anything that we should have talked about, right? What about like Stefan is coaching what percent of the Tyson Hill empty at this year? Um, who do you have? He's got Martin. He's got Martin. He's got Brett. He's got, uh, bonnic. He's got ears. You know, it's like, that's a pretty high percentile, right? Yeah. You know, that's nothing though compared to cuts with the men's physique. He's got 18 of them. Holy crap. You're kidding me, man. He's got like, like, a third or, or more than a third of the men's physique division. He's speaking and coaching for the show. That's wild. I don't know if I could do 18 people in the same show. I mean, maybe you probably don't start there. You know what I'm saying? Like, I've done four or five people in the same show and I can do that. So maybe I'd have to do six before I could get to 18, you know what I'm saying? It's got to be a record. I mean, I, I peaked seven feet for our local show one time, but it was like, did you? No, it was not the Olympia, you know, and they all were in the exact same class where you know attitudes and, especially in men's physique division, these tempers are going to flare. Oh, you gave this guy five more minutes attention than you gave me and I saw you give him something extra. What was that? You know, you didn't have me take it or whatever it might have been. A Sino's got a few guys too. He's got Derek. He's got Vito. He's got Andrew Jack. Yeah. Um, do we know whose coach and Hathi? I don't. Is Hathi still maybe secretly coaching him? I'm wondering. I wonder. I thought that because I think they just had such a good relationship. And I think I'm just going off the cuff here just from stuff I've heard and just what I've observed. A Sino's got a son as well. Oh, it's got a son. Yeah. I don't, I don't think Hathi wanted the pressure or the stress of it and yet other business endeavors he wanted to get into, but I think he does have a special relationship with Hathi. Yeah. I would say that probably kept him. You know, maybe I'm wrong. If someone knows in the comments, please tell me I'm an idiot. Yeah. Yeah. No kidding. Let us know. I love Hathi. He's one of my favorites personally. If, if, and listen, if I know it's it would probably sound better if I were a lot more dramatic about it, but I'd be happy to see any of these guys like up in that, that top six that we looked at. Any of those guys, I think would be incredible. Dude, if Andrew Jack came in and he just blew everybody away, like do you realize like how exciting that would be? You know, I take it. Yeah. Basically what you're saying is we just want to see a really good show. Yeah. Yeah. That's really what it comes down to. And I want to see everybody nail it, man. We spend so much time talking about this stuff, right? And then, you know, the day of the show, it's like what percentage of the guys actually bring it, you know, it's it's not always up there, right? Yeah. We're the forward to the political discord after Hathi, like who got it? Hathi doesn't win. No, it's there's a lot focused around Hathi that gets really nasty. I think that's from his people. Not him, not his people, but I'm saying his country against no question. Yeah. I'm not saying he encourages any of that whatsoever. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, everybody wants to win, especially if you're one of those top five guys, you're looking the best you ever have. And everyone in your campus telling you, oh my God, you blew his legs away. Your back is amazing. You know, it's it's got to be hard to sit there rationally and be like, okay, wait a minute. Let's let me really see what happened. Okay, I can see why I got third place. You know, yeah, it was it wasn't a shot at Hathi. It was a shot at a fan. I didn't think he did. Yeah, it's like, yeah, not sure we care about that. Yeah. All right, I guess that's it. That was literally a whole show of just freaking breaking down. No, since getting into any other stuff right now, you know what I mean? Let's add one trend question in at the end or something. We appreciate you guys tuning in. Thanks for following the show. Like I said, let us know what you guys have. What do you think is going to happen? And also, too, are you going to the Olympia? I've kind of gotten an announcement. I'm going to be going. I didn't plan on it initially and it looks like it's happening. So I'm I'm all booked up. I'm set to go. Any of our listeners that want to meet me, I'll be at the mutant booth. And I'm going to have all of Sunday free. I'm going to be at in Vegas still the whole weekend. So if anybody wants to do anything, if you guys are going to any gyms, you know, let me know if you want to go to the range or something and get a hold of me. And maybe I'll take along with you guys. Skip, are you, are you going out at all? No, I just canceled the hotel a week and a half ago. Okay. I literally, I was coming down to it. And I'm like, you know what? Andres not going Scott's not going. And so when you said you were going, I'm like, you have to be kidding me. I think it was honestly just within the week. Your kids a week ago that I was like, man, you were only going to go till Thursday though, weren't you or something? No, I was going to be there pretty much Sunday to Sunday because my wife was going with me. Yeah. Well, maybe you've dodged a bullet anyway, man, because like I can only handle so long at Las Vegas. Well, and that's why my wife was going because I was only going to spend a couple days around the body by figure today for the expo, probably the finals. And then a day with the amateur, because I have a client in the amateur female bodybuilding. And the rest was, I mean, we were going to stay at the area and, you know, kind of make it a, you know, 80% non bodybuilding 25% out of Vegas. I can only handle Las Vegas for like five days. It's my outside. Yeah. Five days after that, man, it's like my dopamine levels are so drained. My bank account is right there. Right. Exactly. It takes me about bodybuilding shows in general. Like, yeah, like, you know, I like seeing people. And I've gone through so many shows already this year, but the exception to YouTube, I've seen everybody that I know in the industry, you know what I'm saying? And it's like, I go to so many of the national shows and the other pro shows that I don't want to go to the biggest one. I'd rather just sit on my couch with Rachel or whoever's coming to come over and watch and have peace and quiet. And it's also the one weekend that there's for sure no other competition's going on. So I don't have to. There's that. Yeah. It's awesome. Yeah, you got a free weekend. Yeah. So anybody who's coming out, I would love to meet you. I'm literally, so I'm using the Patreon money to fly out. I'm doing this on my own. Mutant is helping me with my accommodations. But I decided I was like, you know what? I just, our show's doing so good. And I, who knows, who knows what'll happen next year. But for now, things are going good. So why don't I like take advantage of that? Because eventually, there's going to be a point that nobody cares to meet me at the Olympics. So, you know, there will always be that day. Tony is going to be there. Tony, stop by. Say hi. I'll come over to strom too. Spend some time with you guys over there. Thanks for tuning in. Everybody, check out BodyBerry.com. Reach out to Antroproaching and TeamSkip.com to reach out to Skip.

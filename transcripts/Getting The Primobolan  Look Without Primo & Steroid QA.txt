 How about this one though? We get you in the best shape you can be. And then that last 10 weeks, Proviron, 50 milligrams every day. I like it. I don't disagree with that at all. How much hardening do you think you get from Proviron? When you're already in shape. Yeah. A good 12 to 15%. Yeah, so like you could kind of get them masked like look. Yeah, that's a really good point actually. I mean, there's a reason why we had Proviron in over the last three, four weeks of a contest. Perhaps just get those finishing touches that the detail level out. What's up guys? Welcome back to Blood, sweat and gear with coaches. Andrew Barry and myself, Scott McNally, Oliver programming is brought to you by, of course, true nutrition.com use our code. Think over there. I just placed an order for the cookie butter, wait, isolate. Oh my god. I'm loving that flavor. We're also, but it used our code. Think over there. Got if I plugged that or not. I just got side track with that flavor. We're also brought to you by supplement source dot C a for Canadians. Great deals that do change week to week. So keep checking the site back for good deals. And of course, Patreon. We have a couple of physique critiques from Patreon today. We've got your listener questions, but we're going to start up with like one of those blah, grab or attention getting questions. And we did talk about this maybe six weeks ago, Andrew on BSG, excuse me on drugs and stuff. And that was now that massed in primo aren't available. How do we get the same effect with other compounds? Yeah. I mean, I think we're all running into a little bit of shortage with that with our clients or, you know, at least myself, I, I stocked up on some of that stuff. I tell all my clients, like keep a pharmacy on hand. You just never know when you're going to want this or that, you know, or when I'm going to want you to have this or that. Yeah. But, you know, to answer the question, how do we get around getting, achieving a look that we're getting from DHG like compounds, like prima bowl and, and master on when we're out of them? And I think simple, simple answer is you're going to have to include some form of DHG drug, like an anivar or a windstrol. Maybe both actually. And, and my answer would probably be a testosterone base, like you would be using with either one of those master on a primo bowl. And I would probably stick with EQ. And then I would probably run both anivar and windstrol. I feel like anivar gives me a little bit more of a pump look, whereas the windstrol is going to give a little bit more of that drier look. Kind of what you would get with the primo bowl and master on combo, if you know what I mean. Yeah. In terms of doses, you know, let's say someone's running a contest prep stack where they're doing something like, let's just say an average of 600 milligrams of test austro and maybe 300 mass, 300, pre-mobile. Okay. Maybe a little bit higher on the primo and master on, but we'll say 400 of each just for, for giggles. I would probably run the EQ equal to my test austro. So like a 600, 600 there. And then I would be doing probably a 50, 50, 50 milligrams of both windstrol and anivar. And I think you're going to be able to achieve a very similar look with running those compounds. What do you think? Yeah. So I guess here's a thought. You know, I know that primo and master have gotten so popular because in part, people are running a year round, you know, there's the astringentrol element that everybody wants to get. And I think we get that more from primo than we do for a mast. And you know, I think we can get that from EQ, but I don't think it's across the board for everyone. But I, you know, I am seeing it to a degree. And I think part of it too has to do with the ratio. Like are you on 700 tests 300 EQ? Well, there's that. And don't think it has a strong enough fact as a lesser primo might. Of course, everybody's different. So from that regard, especially like off season, then, you know, just to get the astringent control effect, I would look at aqua poise for sure. And the, and really hears the other thing is that years back when I started, and it makes me sound old, which I am getting old now, the, like, but man, back then we didn't look at the DHTs until the contest prep. And it was really like the last eight weeks that we started adding them in anyway. And maybe we just have to go back to the old school kind of bubbly or a rounder look in the off season, you know? Yeah, I agree. And I don't think that might be a bad thing. What if we find this Andrew, masked and premaragon and everybody frickin explodes. They're taking more tests in EQ and other compounds now. And all of a sudden, they start to, I don't know, start going really crazy. I'll say this though, last eight weeks, that's, that's, I would probably pick Winstrel would be my route. And I might do, I mean, honestly, if we were going to use trend, then we're going to work trying in the way we've worked in regardless, which is generally for me eight weeks out on average, trend ace, and usually we can go with no more than 200 per week. And that's for really almost any level of contest prep, you know, competitor. I found that you don't need to go crazy high with it. And maybe we even do a little bit less if you wanted to. If we're talking, if we're talking just somebody who, well, hold on a second, I'm interrupting myself. And if we did that, then maybe four to five weeks out, we could add that Winstrel in at 50. And maybe even for the last week or two, maybe even go to a little higher, 75, even 100. You know, and if you're, if my other thought would be, I think a lot of our guys are non competitors. So in that case, I mean, what, what will we do for that? Yeah. I mean, I think in that case, like a lot of situations, whether it's premable and master on or any, any PD, the dosing is going to be a little bit lower. So let's say you're, you know, you're 40 years old, like I am, right? And you want to achieve a nice, let's say an eight to 10 week outlook. And that's where you like to stay for the most part, right? I still, I like your option. I like my option, but I would just say the doses probably don't need to be as high. You know, you're not getting competitively on stage. You don't need to be, you know, 225 pounds shredded. So why use those doses? So give you a number. Let's, let's say, you know, I mean, as someone that's doing really well with really low dose of test, just injections daily. Yeah. I would say, you know, maybe an average of 30 milligrams of testosterone a day. Okay. So what's that? Three times that's 210 milligrams a week, right? So somewhere in that ballpark. And then I would probably in that situation, I would probably just stick with the wind straw and anavar. So maybe 25 and 25 of each. And then maybe titrate in just a little bit of trend, 15 to 20 milligrams a day. That's one, you know, that one, maybe I'd probably run for six weeks at a time. And then I'd pull some back out. So, you know, because my mindset here is like, okay, you want to achieve a certain look, but you don't want to take the inherent risks that come with taking risk of doses of PDs that people that are in contest prep, they know that, you know, when they're doing those things, I'm at risk for taking minutes off my life at the back end in some way, shape, or form. If I'm not properly, you have an end date and site. It's a short term, you know, but if we're talking about a sustainable thing, I would probably bring the trend in and I'd bring it back out. I'd bring it back in maybe a four weeks on, four weeks off, like every other month, you know, and I would advise people if they're going to try to do that, get your labs done, you know, at least, you know, every other month for the first three months to see if you can get a pattern of health, you know, maintaining health and then maybe gets a little bit salty and then you bring it back to baseline, you know, I got one. I got one that I didn't think about when I talked about this with Dave either. So yeah, you know, off or excuse me, noncompetitor, he's, I generally look at that as being, we want to get you looking good and then say, keep you looking good for the summer, you know, so we're not looking to peak for one hour of one day. We're trying to think of what is more sustainable. How about this? So number one, you and I both know in our audience, and those two, if they've gotten in shape, the condition is everything. If you get in really good shape, if you're just even on a modest, ghosted test, you're going to look nasty. In fact, I have a client. I, if I would have asked him, he probably would have let me put his pictures up. And you'd ask me like, well, how much DHT is he taking? He's taking just TRT and he is going to look harder than some guys on stage that are, that are, you know, juiced up. So how about this one though? We get you in the best shape you can be. And then that last 10 weeks, provide run, 50 milligrams every day. I like it. I don't disagree with that at all. How much hardening, how much hardening do you think you get from provide run? When you're already in shape, a good 12 to 15%. Yeah. So like you could kind of get them masked like look, you know, that's a really good point actually. I mean, there's a reason why we had, uh, provider in over the last three, four weeks of a contest prep to just get those finishing touches, the detail level out. Um, on that note, what's as high as you go on like provider and over the last, let's say eight to 10 days. Dude, I honestly, man, haven't gone. I haven't used a lot of it. I feel like it's, and I was going to ask you, do you feel like it's falling by the wayside to a degree, but I would go up to 100. Okay. Um, yeah. So I used to only go as high as 100, but more prevelently now I'm bringing it as high as 150. And I'll be honest, I'll do the same thing with windstrawl over the last four to five days. So I'm just, you know, take home point. I'm not talking for when you start windstrawl, you're running 150 milligrams a day for six, eight weeks. I'm saying for the last four to five days, I do drive that up, but keep in mind, we're also pulling injectables out usually about a week out. So, you know, your actual total load of PEDs is going down in that final week. Yeah. Yeah. But I think my big limiting factor with PIVA, PIVA is cost, you know, because the more, so I'm kind of like, how much can we take? But then how much do you have to, you know, and then we try to figure out, okay, well, you can do this many per day for the next whatever weeks. I'll say this also too, because it's a, it's an issue I run into a lot with clients. And I know other coaches do too. And, and coaches are always scrambling calling each other, texting each other. Hey, do you have any clients locally that have this or that? Guys, when you set up your contest prep pretend like your show is actually like three weeks after the date that you set up because you might actually want to do another show the following weekend or two weeks later. Yeah. But you just never know. I would rather have someone have half a bottle of this leftover than to be half a bottle short and be scrambling, you know, counting down the pills and begging buddies, hey, can I get three tabs of you for Thursday? And then can I get three tabs from someone else for Friday? That's, that's always stressful to a coach when it's like, dude, you knew we're doing the show and you can count the, how many pills you have and roughly, I gave you an outline at the beginning of prep of what to expect. You didn't even get the amount that's going to cover what to expect. It's kind of annoying, you know what I mean? Yeah. And, and I think too, this is, it's a hard conversation to explain. But if you know, like, okay, so I need, you know, 30 doses, I have three vials. You assume that's 30 milliliters, but then you draw to the one. And there's that little dead space in this range where you, you know, the first couple of cycles I did, I was like, man, they're shorting me. I only got eight mills out of this, you know, that's good point too. It's like, what, how, how would you counteract that? I'd tell people like draw to the eight, you know what I mean? My thing is always have extra bottles. Yeah. Just just have buy an extra bottle. Yeah, that's probably easier. Yeah, I know our sports expensive and, and our, you know, our coaching fees and the travel and everything that goes into competing. But at the end of the day, for you to achieve your absolute best look, you're not going to spend an extra 250 bucks. You just spent 2000 or whatever on this whole prep or 5000, whatever it might be. You're not going to spend an extra 250 to make sure you have one extra bottle of three or four of these things to make sure you're covered through the end your prep, you know? That, that, that, that always gets me, oh, I didn't want to have stuff laying around. It's like, well, you're going to prep again. You told me you wanted to do nationals year after. It's not going to expire in six or eight months. So you're already got a jumpstart on your stash for next time. You know, that's how I ended up with my box that Dave has talked about. Dave's like every time you've run anything over the past several years, you just happen to have a little bit of this. It's that was my extras, you know, he is so right about that because I, I can see my box right now. Actually, my box is pretty empty now at this point. I'll be honest. Yeah. I've used it mostly up, except for the trend, you know? And that way, if you're buying a fresh amount of stuff for your stack for this next contest prep or this next off season, and you have half a bottle win straw and half bottle of anavar and half a bottle of, uh, provider and maybe you have three of them because you did three preps over the last six years. So you actually have probably enough for your whole contest prep, but still order your stack. Yeah. Well, I think we gave him some good take home points on that one. What do you think? I do. All right. If you're in the market for protein powder, check out true nutrition.com. They literally have like every protein powder under the sun. I go with their cold filtered weight isolate or their team skip blend. I prefer the chocolate, peanut butter cut, but there's a few flavors that I like. Let me know if you have any questions about that. Victoria, my wife, she gets the pea protein isolate that's rare to find a pea isolate. Most of them are concentrate. So the isolate is super low in carbs. Regardless of your diet, they will have a protein powder for you and you get to flavor it how you want and buy it by how many of your pounds you want. So check them out true nutrition.com. They're the first company that ever supported our podcasting. So we support them. You can support us by shopping with true nutrition and using our code. Think so we had a bunch of we have two physique critiques. I'm going to start with one of these in in bear with me a little bit because this is there not going to be a perfect order here. And I'm still getting used to doing the screen share on this particular program. But he has a new Patreon member. So I want to say thank you to him very much. And it's Marino is his name. Okay. And he says, uh, what's up guys? Uh, listen to the show for two years. Absolutely love it. Okay. Physique critique. Let me see if he gives me any any information. He says, um, I'd be interested to hear your honest opinions on my potential and bodybuilding. I've competed in one show in 2023 as a middleweight. Since then I've battled injuries, including a pectare. But now my embankant full swing. Uh, my goal is to grow into the light heavies and try to get a pro card. I'm currently five weeks into a grow phase at 188 pounds. Uh, for my current check in. Okay. I don't see the pectare to you. So I really squinted right in here and this is the best pectare I've ever seen. Um, yeah, I know, right? I, there's no deformity. So I would say I would also ask him when did he tear his peck and how did he do it? And I bet it was after his contest prep when he felt really strong and he'd hide, you know, the muscles are, um, you know, full fluid and glycogen again, but the joints are just a month or two behind, uh, because I've had clients do that. I've, I've had partial tears myself not even doing your typical bench press exercises, uh, just from getting strong very quickly. Yeah. But, um, I think he's got a good physique. He's got a nice taper. Uh, his shoulders tie into his waist really well. He's got a nice taper there. Um, from the front, you know, what I'm seeing is he's got a nice taper. He just needs more, you know, he's got a good structure. I think he just needs more of everything, you know, good shape there in that front double, right? And look at those. Yeah. I mean, and he, to think he's only, I wouldn't, I don't know how tall he is, but he, I wouldn't peg him as a 180 something pounds right now. You know what I mean? I would have already said he looked like a, a light heavy to me. Yeah. I would agree with that. Like if you were to say he was floating at 215 or something like that, I would have been, I totally believe in that. Um, he looks like, you know, when he gets lean his legs probably look really nice because you can still see his tutorial lines coming through at this body weight. Let me see that back shot. All right. Here's rear relaxed. I think he had something to with a hamstring. Uh, I didn't read all of it here. Um, buddy said, uh, what was it? Um, September 20, 23. I was doing a barbell rose, went down for rep seven and felt a pop come up to find out. It was a partial tear of my PSL. Um, all of the pain I felt was right behind my knee and in the hamstring. Um, we've all had those. Yeah. Yeah. So it doesn't look like it was, yeah, you, if you've had some tears and injuries, man, like you, you've, you've got the best recovery, uh, possible. Yeah. Um, I'm going to stick with what I said. He just needs to keep growing and needs, he needs more of everything. Um, like I don't see a major structural weakness. I don't see a major muscle deficiency. If I had to nitpick, I would say maybe the back does need more than the others, I guess, but, um, let's see the front last bread. And see here's the front lines. Yeah, just more. I mean, I wish I could give him some more concrete, uh, I got one for him. What do you know? And he probably already knows this. If he popped a hamstring fiber and, you know, tore, tore something down there and, and he's a little bit scared. Here's a deal, man. I feel like when you have a strong muscle part, like quads, then the opposing muscle part needs to be that much better to not look weak, you know what I mean? So when he turns around, I feel like the hams could be stronger. Let's see a side-chats, you know, the side leg looks. I mean, he's got a hamstring drop. So, yeah, you know, that is there. But I would like to see maybe more hams and glutes. Yeah. But more, you know, more back work, especially if you can do deadlifts, I feel like those things are probably like you said, man, just keep growing and it's going to come, you know? Yeah. I would just take your time. I wouldn't, I wouldn't say off these pictures that I would, you know, if I had an athlete like this that I'd be like, oh, we're definitely going to get a pro card. But I would say everything happens the right way. You know, you could land in a first call out for sure. And then it's just about whoever shows up, you know? Yeah. You know, and I don't say that as like a throw in a shade or to, to dampen anyone's, you know, dreams or goals, but could he absolutely turn pro? Yes. With just more time and volume, and volumeization of his tissue, absolutely. He's got, he's got a good structure, you know? Yeah. I'm with you 100%. Man. All right. I'll bring up the other one here. Give me just a minute. You can, you can fill for me, Andrew. Yeah. For sure. Absolutely. Um, let's see. We've got in the comments right now. Thanks for the reply to the email Scott. This is from Sharp. Oh, man. Sharp. He's just massed. Sharp started a podcast. Oh, cool. Okay. What he does is he coaches himself, himself. He always buys significantly more than he needs and reference to the last topic that we talked about. He says he's got drawers full. See, that's what I'm talking about. See, so now he doesn't have to get mad at himself for not having stuff at a time. All right. I got us, got us here. Oh, cool. All right. So, hold on just a second here. And I want to bring her email up. Let's see. Um, I thought I was all set. Okay. So this is Chelsea. And this is her actual, this is her reminder email. So I know I can tell you offhand, while you look at this front shot, that she's been competing in both figure and women's physique. Here's her email. She says she's competed twice now. My first show, I got first place in women's physique, this and second in figure went to nationals, got third place in women's physique and fourth in figure. I love both divisions. I would love to do women's physique and not have to hold myself back in doing figure. However, I'm not sure about chasing the dragon. Definitely when I keep my femininity and I, and I continue to have feelings around the lack of separation between women's physique and women's bodybuilding. Any thoughts are appreciated? Absolutely. Love your show. All of them, especially being, uh, you know, a hardcore bodybuilder. All right. I'm sorry. I was just reading the comments. I just realized who maddened emailed me as well. And I completely just blanked on that. I missed his as well too, man. Well, no, I responded to him. So about several good, good, good ideas of people he should have on his show. He wants it to be a little different than just bodybuilding talk. A little bit more. We'll say cerebral than, than what you and I do. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, okay. So here's a front shot. Here's a back shot. I'll run through a few more of these. Check this state shot out. Yeah, I want to see what she looks like. Oh, wow. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I mean, the only problem I see, the only thing I see is. Got to work on the on the lower abdominal tension. And a lot of times with our athletes that will say aren't in their young 20s or early 30s, a lot of that just has to do with muscle memory and getting after those vacuums over and over and over again and retraining the muscles. Let's see the top picture. Do you ever have people do, um, planks? Yeah. So I've had people that I found we started doing vacuums and like we saw some improvement. And then we added planks in and we don't have to go crazy with them. Like 30 second low plank three times, you know, at the end of your workout. And then 30 second low plank, 30 second high plank rest three times. And just through doing that alone, I found that it has made a difference. Wait, what are you saying is a low plank versus a high plank down on the elbows versus up on the hands? I got. You know, so it's more of just a transition and a slightly different angle. And I feel like when you've been down on your hands or on your elbows, you know, for 30 seconds, then going up on your hands feels different and allows you to extend it. You know, and then I started looking into reverse planks like off of a bench. What's a river like a hang? No, you would keep your body straight, but your lower back kind of would be on the bench. And you just make like a straight line. You'd be like 45 degree angle kind of thing. Never thought of that, but that makes sense. Yeah. Maybe not 45, you know, 30 degree angle, whatever. No one's bringing a protractor out. Yeah. What's that picture of her on stage with like several other women in the lineup? Yeah. That's her second from the left. Is that right? I'm trying to tell right now. I think yes. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I'm going to say conditioning needs to come up, especially in the legs. Um, and then I'm going to stick with what I said about the, uh, the midsection. Like do you see the woman next to her in the middle? Yeah. The reason why she's in the middle there and the girl next to her girl next to her in the later purple? Yep. Yeah. They're, they're tapered. They're, they're, they're able to pull their abs in. You don't have to be able to do a full vacuum. No one asked me to do a bum instead, um, in your figure shot. But you should be able to pull them in a little, a little bit harder to create that nice V shape. The other thing I'm seeing with her, and this is just a simple thing. She's got to be able to pull her tron, her bottoms up a little bit more. And she can create more of a V taper. Keep it up a little bit. Yeah. Um, do you see how like just to give an example, you can tell this woman in the middle is probably very experienced. She's probably done multiple national shows. Yeah. She's tapered her suit to give her that, that nice V taper. And it's creating more of an optical illusion to us that she has more of a taper than she really does. That's a great point, man. Huge point. Yeah. So Chelsea were to do that. Um, she, it would increase her taper. Yeah. I see why she's in, you know, in the mix here, she's got the muscularity. She's got as much muscle. If not, I think she has more muscle than any of these. Look at those legs she has. Can't put the rest of them. She just needs like another probably three or four weeks to really get crazy conditioning to where she walks out there. And it's in it's a done deal. Yeah. 100%. Now it's funny. It's her midsection. It looks better here than it did on stage. So maybe it's an issue of the, the car bump loading. Yeah. Yeah. What they did with, um, with food leading into the show because she's showing or maybe she's really worked on it since that show. She's showing better abdominal control. Yeah. Here is a slight posing thing. See how she's leaning forward a little bit. I sure do. Yeah. She's not showing us how big she really is by leaning forward like that. Okay. So she just, I always do this like I'm the one doing it. Like I'm the one posing. Yeah. Yeah. She just needs to arch her chest a little bit more. Yeah. And, um, she's going to look bigger and her taper and structure are just going to improve with. I totally see that man. Look at those calves too. You know, she has some, some calves on her wheels in general. Right. You should see my training partners, calves, dude. Oh, yeah. She's got ridiculous calves like, yeah, way better than mine. Yeah. Almost probably almost as good as yours. Oh, minor shrinking, man. I mean, years in your prime. You should have seen me when I was my best. Yeah. Yeah. Um, all right. So we do have a bunch of listener questions and oh, I didn't mention it. If you're new to our content and you enjoy our shows, we'd love to have you along. Hit the subscribe button. Hit the bell. We'll let you know that when our stuff comes out, we do have several shows that come out each week. Um, only if you really like it though, like you don't have to do us any favors. We want to have people here that enjoy our stuff and our learning. And we love teaching you guys this stuff too. And you're somebody replied from your IGF comment or topic last episode, a couple episodes ago. Says I've taken IGF on three cycles. The first time was the craziest experience. Crazy full pumps with that insulin like response that shuttles carbs correctly. And I gained a new level of vascularity at the same body fat that last, um, that lasted for months after I stopped taking the cycle. Unfortunately, that source went away and I could never find IGF like that again. That sounds like my story, man. Yeah. I mean, I think the reason why IGF does and LR three are still fairly popular or still being sold is because everyone knows someone that had results like that while using it. And they're like, okay, well, maybe I was just dosing it wrong. Maybe I was, I wasn't taking a bilaterally or I wasn't using enough or maybe my source wasn't as good as this person's source. So I do think I'm not saying they don't work. I'm just saying the multiple times I've tried it, I didn't really see anything, but I keep obviously trying every couple of years because I know someone that is responding from it. And did you get it from the same place too? I can't remember now. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I do remember though, man, I'd get really good fullness from it. And I ended up saying to myself, you know what? I just need more shoulders. I'm just going to put it in my shoulders every day, you know, and I put it in the left one one day, right one the next day in the bathroom at Powerhouse right before I stepped out into the gym floor. Well, staring at the sign that says any use of illegal compounds will have your membership taken away immediately. No, I never saw that sign. Never noticed it once. Okay. Oh, I got to tell you too. I got to give you an update, man. It says, Scott, I agree. I have tried both with Reda and I find that once weekly doses does more than smaller, more frequently. I'm going back to twice a week. And I get it, but you know, and I talked to Victoria about this because she had been using Semiglutide or, yes, Semiglutide for since 2016, I think. But anyway, she had said that, you know, you do notice that it's not as strong by the end of the week, but she does like the fact that you do get that big spike. You know, you are going to get a bigger spike, bigger overall spike from it. And it does have, you know, decent half life. But I am finding that I do better overall with having the more consistent hum, controlling my hunger and keeping things stable with two shots per week of Reda. So I tried it. I tried it. All right. Could the fact that I've been taking 50 milligrams of Winstrow, 30 anivr, an 80 mics a day of Climbutra all for 32 days now, plus microdosing, redditry tied for 12 days at 1.6 milligrams per week, by the result of experiencing severe acid reflex for the last two days, hiccups that won't stop for hours after eating my meals. And so now I have to throw up. Could all of this be the result of acid reflex in digestion? I have managed to lose 25 pounds on this cycle while doing three hours of stairmaster a day, 90 in the morning, 90 to 100 minutes at night. Should I stop taking the orals and continue with the Reda along with my 500 test per week? Three hours of cardio a day on the stairs. Ooh, that's a lot of dedication, man. That's, yeah, you climb in the Statue of Liberty, like that's wild. I would say, I think it's questions you've asked and why is he having the, the, the, the the first? Yeah, the indigestion. Yeah, I mean, it could be a combination of both, but my first thought would be the Reda with the, the delayed gastric emptine. I would imagine what you're probably experiencing is a, probably a delay in, or food backing up and compounding bacteria feeding off some of that food and then creating gas and whatnot. And you might be running into a problem where you're going to give yourself SIBO eventually. So, what my first move is I would cut the Reda. Yeah. And I would, it sounds like you've taken a, a good chunk of fat right off and, and, and you're maintaining pretty well. So I would pull the Reda, but be cognizant that you're going to probably get hit with a wave of hunger pretty quickly. So have a plan to deal with that, whether it's, you know, warm tea, which is usually my go-to with athletes is, you know, make sure you're drinking like warm teas or maybe even some decaf coffee if it's later in the day. But that would be my first move. Pull the Reda for two weeks and see how you do and if it clears up. If it doesn't, then you know it's not the Reda. And you know, it's probably the compounded oils that you're taking. Yeah, and I kind of get it. So he's been on, he said the Reda for just 12 days now. And listen, if you're already taking two different, I don't know, let me say this. I'd put it in this order. Reda true tide first, then the clan in winst, or excuse me, then the winstrel in Anivar and the clan is probably nothing to do with any of this, you know. So it's the least of it, yeah. Yeah. My thought would be I agree 100% pull the Reda out and get your digestion back on track. I would also add a digestive enzyme in if he's not using one already. I really like the now food super enzymes that has all your basic amylase light base, everything plus it has like papaya extract and some other things that may or may not be additionally helpful, but it also has a low dose of HCl. And it also contain hydrochloride. Yeah. And it has a low dose of it has that in it too, but it has a low dose of ox bile in it as well. If he's got any fats in there. So it kind of hits everything from, you know, those three different angles. And I find it to work really well for people, just one cap, you know, with a meal. And I'd start with just maybe a couple meals, you're two largest meals. And then from there, maybe build up just to kind of get that food moving better overall and help that digestion. But yeah, I would take the cap, the digestive agent mid meal to you mentioned that before. You talked to somebody who specialized in this, right? Yeah, I did. And I can't remember who now, but it was a digestive expert who specializes not in body building, but in digestion in general with people who have issues with gastric motility and whatnot and their advice and what their protocol is to take it mid meal because you want to get the initial release of the enzymes. You want the pancreas to release the enzymes that it should release. You don't want to like trick the pancreas into not releasing them. So you want to get the release, but then you want to supplement it with what it's probably lacking to help with the further digestion of the food. And then the other thing I was going to say is to help with the gastric motility, definitely try it some magnesium citrate, you know, maybe 300 milligrams in the morning with meal one and then another 300 milligrams with like your evening or later afternoon meal and see if that will help as well with pushing and moving food along. And lastly, stay in hydrated and hydrated, meaning not just water, but with the electrolytes. Dude, we probably should have, I mean, besides taking the red out, I think that's probably we should have started there. You know, that's like, well, but it sounds like you said that it started, you started noticing the side effect shortly after starting the red. Yeah, no, I mean, take the red out. And then like I mentioned enzymes and HCL, and I think you're, you know, you're suggesting of water is probably like, we remove the red out, make sure you water is good, you know. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. For sure. Yeah. And let me ask you this then, let's say he gets everything back on track after, you know, everything's better. Within one week, he says, Hey, I'm feeling good. What would you do with the red of then? Well, I would say what your goal, like do you, do you, are you using it for the appetite, suppressing effect or are you using it to help continue to get leaner or improve some impaired glucose and sensitivity, insulin and sensitivity? So my answer would be based on that. If he's at the conditioning that he that he's happy with, then I would say, leave it out. You don't know, we don't need to stay on these compounds forever. Take it out. And then, but if he still wants to continue to lose and he still, you know, I mean, three hours of cardio day, that's, that's a lot, especially if you're not getting on stage, you know, that's, that's dedication, you know. Yeah. Um, yeah, I would add it back in, but I probably wouldn't go right back to the same dose. I would probably start it, you know, maybe half the dose he was taking. Yeah. If you get, yeah, get the benefits out of it without the side effects, you know, and I think as far as like what I would do coaching, I wouldn't have somebody running, you know, windstrolling antivar in clean at 80 long term. I want to better overall plan that and, you know, we've talked about how I run clean and I learned it from my coach who learned it from Dave Palumbo, starting at, I start lower now, he would start at 40. I started at 20 and then a couple weeks later when we need to make another change, go to 40, you know, maybe it's two, maybe it's three weeks, go to 60, go to 80. I get up to about 100, maybe 120 and then we take a break, but 32 days in to 80 micrograms of clean, doesn't sound like something I would do. What do you think? Depends on the situation. And so like when I'm starting someone out, like an early and prep, I'm probably going to hit them hard for like 20 days, meaning, going to start with 40 and then every five days we're going to bump it up 20 until we get to about 100 or 120. Yeah. And I say that the situation I should let it eradicate on like the situation would be like, they're not coming to me super insulin sensitive, like diadid before we start the diet. You need to give them a shove. You get it move. We need, that's a great way to put it. We need to give them a shove into the hole. And then we, and then we'll pull it back out and we'll rely just on conventional dieting methods to, you know, maybe till about 10 weeks out and then we'll throw the clean back in. Then the other thing is, okay, let's say we're four weeks out, we're behind or we're four weeks out and a client's like, I really want to jump into this show, you know, three weeks out instead of four weeks out. Yeah. Okay, we're probably going to hit hard. I'm probably going to skip 20 and 40 mics. I'll probably just jump to 60. Yeah. And we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll tie trade it up from there. But clean is funny because everyone has their system where everyone has their way in a million different ways work. Yeah. What you're describing works, taking it 20 mics, you know, I think Dave does 20 mics with like several meals throughout the day, I believe if I'm not wrong, versus one like bullies dose in the morning or two bullies doses throughout the day. I might know, I don't think he did back then, but that was a long time ago. I've seen so many protocols work with client that I think as a coach, you need to try something that makes sense and then see if that's working and then replicate that again, like every couple of weeks. I mean, I might run clean for 10 to 15 days and then pull it out for seven to 10 days before adding it back in. Yeah. That's typically what I'll do. And then, um, and then okay, maybe the way I'm running it's not working. So I need to change a different strategy with how I'm utilizing it. Maybe I need to hit them harder with it and run it for just like four days at a time with four days off. Yeah. Or I know a lot of people do, uh, client came to me today. She's doing, you know, two days on one day off and then every like three weeks, she'll take a five day stretch off to give the, the receptors a break. So there's a million ways to cut it. I don't know if anyone's right or anyone's completely wrong. I just think you need to look at how your clients reacting to it and, and, and, you know, keep programming appropriately. Yeah. Yeah. I'm with you on that 100%. I think for him too, it's like if he is doing that much cardio, like what, and and I'm not saying like, but what is going on with the diet is it sounds like he's really having to like force his body to make the progress. You know, I just wonder if, if there's something else up like, you know, where's your thyroid at and stuff like that? To me, if someone's doing three hours of cardio and they're not just like at that last, like, you know, 10 days just to get that last bit a little bit off to be just completely peeled, the answer isn't to keep push harder. The answer pull back, right? I would imagine, and he can try this. I would give yourself a full five days off of cardio and I would bump your carbs up, probably double what you're eating. So let's just pretend like he's eating two 50 gram carb meals a day out of his six meals. I would say add another 50 grams to two other meals and just monitor for that four or five days, maybe pull back on your training, even. I would actually insist that two of those days are non training days at the minimum, if not three out of the five that were taken off. And I'm going to probably push KSM 66 at you. I'm not even, I'm not even going to have you stick to your step goal. You know, if your step goal is 10 K a day, I'm probably going to say, let's pull back to five and don't even really keep track. Yeah. And I want you to sleep in and get to bed early. So, yes, I want to give you a dream, a dream, a dream. I think that could be possibly, I mean, it depends on how long he's been doing this too, but I think that could be a really good move. It's hard sometimes for somebody to take that advice when they know, like, I'm afraid I'm going to get fat, you know, but I, something along those lines, I think, could probably be a good move. I can give you an example. Like I get lots of women that have been pushing, pushing, pushing, you know, hour and a half a cardio day, you know, 30 to 50 grams of carbs total. And they've been stuck gaining and losing the same one pound for two, three, four, five weeks, right? And I'm like, my first move is pull all the cardio out. We're going to pull your training to three very low intensity sessions this week. No step goals, but I do want you to go outside and get a walk in the sunlight. And, you know, by the end of the week, they're down to 1,5 pounds. And that just boggles them because it never crossed their mind that doing less and pulling back and resting the adrenals is what was needed, you know. And you got admire that their mindset was, no, I'll just work harder. I got to work harder, you know, they're willing to do the work, but sometimes the work isn't the answer. Sometimes pulling back is the answer. Yep. I'm with you 100% on that, man. All right. My girlfriend was stuck at 135 for weeks. Clean diet and exercise goal was 128, gave her 1 milligram of red, another reddit question per week and in two weeks, boom, six pounds off. Oh, shoot. I lost my question. Hold on a second. I'm coming back. I'm coming back. She lost six pounds. She's a couple. So she's exceeded her goal, basically. Yeah, six pounds off. And from there, what does she say? Stuff is crazy. She didn't like the way she felt though very tired and sleeping more. 120 ounces of water per day, electrolytes and collagen. Did you say anything about PEDs? Nothing about PEDs, nothing about, yeah, nothing about diet either or anything else. Well, I mean, but she's eating clean, I think. Yeah, clean diet and exercise. Well, just the very nature of prep and you got to think, I try to use this metaphor of the day, right? We're up for 17, 16, 17 hours out of the day and then we got a sleep for six, seven hours, eight hours. If we can, to regenerate for the next day. And if we break our time of dieting into like these little, like, let's say three or four week meso cycles where, okay, we're going to, we can push hard for three out of those weeks, but we got to kind of pull back at some point for at least a slightly extended period of time to allow the adrenals to rest to be able to have another push again, you know? I mean, all of our diets are really contested, press prep is just a series of, you know, digging deep and then pulling back, digging deep and pulling back. And we're pulling back to confuse the brain into thinking that we're not doing all this work, right? That's essentially what we're trying to do is confuse the brain and the body into thinking, okay, it's safe now. We could liberate some energy. He's not just storing all this energy and pushing, pushing, pushing, you know? So that's what I think. All right, Mr. Question, is she stalling? What? I just read Matt Sharp's question. Oh, I missed the question, is she stalling? But it sounds like she didn't stall. She dropped six pounds and now she's just kind of fatigued out of it. Yeah, I think that's her main concern is the fatigue. Oh, this might get you started. I don't want to get you started on the pharmaceutical industry, but I think you're going to find this one interesting, man. That's probably in reference to Geno Shake and testing gear. I've used him with a lot, I've used him a lot with the business that I'm in. And as an experiment, just to check Geno's accuracy, I sent in Walgreens from a brand Watson test sip 200 milligrams. I was assuming that it would be a great benchmark, but to my surprise, it came back in 189 milligrams. And I know that legally FDA is allowed 5% margin of error, error to be above or below claims. But just to make sure it wasn't a one off in accuracy and the lab measurements, I sent in three samples from three different bottles of Watson. All three of the 200 milligrams sip came back at 189 to 191 milligrams and knowing there are a lot of 5% margin of error. The conclusion I drew is that it's far too much of a coincidence that they are consistently 5% under. It seems to be rather deliberate. And when you're dealing with millions of bottles that could little bit could add up, sounds like farmers getting greedy in that situation, just saving a penny of bottle times a million. Not necessarily. And I'll tell you what I think is because you know when you get a 200 milligram bottle of first CC bottle of test sip, it's not 200 milligrams of testosterone. It's 100 and I think they're actually accurately does for what you're getting, right? Like when you say, oh, I'm taking 900 milligrams of test a week, you're not actually injecting 900 milligrams of testosterone because you're taking the account. The oil is actually as well, the ester weight exactly. So so they're expected to be a little bit lower. Are they? Yeah. And the fact that every single bottle came back at 189 tells me that they're very that the precision is there. So yeah, I don't think that I don't think they're doing anything wrong. Yeah. Like, you know, that too is that sometimes not sometimes I'm not sure what brand I have here, but it's firma and it two milliliters vials or one milliliters, one milliliters vials. And they're all like 1.2 almost. It's like 1.1, you know, 1.15. There's a little bit more than a mill in each bottle. Okay. Like, what do we know what type of testosterone it is? What did he say? But is there, is there, are they sip you need? Yeah. Yeah, test sip. All right. I'm just because I couldn't remember the exact number, but I just did a quick search and a, if you're asking about a, this is for an anti a 250 milligram bottle test testosterone and anti contains approximately 180 milligrams of actual testosterone. This is because the testosterone and anti molecule includes the an anti ester attached to the testosterone molecule. The S that adds weight. So a 250 milligram dose of testosterone, E contains a lower amount of active substance. So it's the raw test is that, but I, I would figure that you were testing for how much test is in there. That's what I assumed. You know what I mean? Well, so, so what I'm saying is I bet if you look at the packaging on Watson's 200 milligram testosterone, it'll say active ingredient 189 or somewhere around that doubt. 180 something milligrams of testosterone and then it'll also say the ester. Yeah. Okay. So I don't, I don't think they're cheating. I would love to say they are. I trust me. Like, I think that they're all scumbags, but, but I, I don't think in this case, um, they're doing anything faulty here, you know, and I guess like, uh, it's like, okay, when I go and get my green tea supplement and it says it's 600 milligrams of green tea, but then it'll say like, you know, 180 milligrams of actual Catechine, which is the, the, the active and green. Right. No, I get what you mean. Yeah. Yeah. All right. I've got one, another one for you. Has anyone tried injectable SLU P332? Yeah. I have not, because I've just been so pleased with the oral, I thought you started with the injectable. I, I was going to go. So I found a company before if I, I found parabolic peptides, I think through you, um, where I was going to buy a bunch of raw powder, because you could just buy it. And I was just going to make my own preparations and sterilize it and inject. Okay. I thought you ended up still getting that is injectable version. All right. Well, the, in the issue is though, and I know people are doing experiments online. Yeah. The, to, to use the same amounts that are done in Brat studies, it ends up being quite a bit. Oh, yeah. And my fear is that I don't need my mitochondria to run wild. You know, I want them efficient. Yeah. I don't need them, you know, I don't need to run myself into metabolic disease. Yeah. And I don't want to be the one that does that. And, you know, teach the rest of us, you know, exactly. You know, I'm a, I may don't get greedy. Take what you can get, but don't get greedy about it. You know, and I've been very pleased with the SLU oral. I took a break from it. I had been running it since, you know, I discovered it back in January, February, January. And I was doing really, really well. And then I just felt like I just wasn't getting the same bump out of it anymore. I wasn't getting the same benefit and the same cognitive boost. So I took a break. And while I was taking a break, I tried five amino M, one MQ. I honestly, man, I dosed this stuff up to relatively high dose. I didn't get anything, anything at all out of it. I don't think. So I know that people, some people have, but hey, it just goes to show that I guess everybody's different. Have you had any experience with the five amino? I have not taken it, but I have many clients that have taken it and not a zilch. Okay. I think, I think the five MQ and some of these other compounds are more hype and more in lab rats, more in theory, this will happen, but I don't think it, I don't think they pan out in actual human studies on themselves. Yeah, I've heard people talking about it like crazy, you know, like it was this new great thing and have you tried it and all that. So I was saving it and I didn't find I got much, much from it. One I have gotten a lot from is data though. And I find it more appealing. Yeah, I like it. And I've used it intermittently and I found some really good benefit from it. I was going to try another experiment. I got some MK677 ahead and used it in years, and you're like years, right? And my thought was, so after, you know, Scott and I talked about it years back, a few years ago. And we found that in some studies, it showed that you would, you know, definitely get benefit after a day, a lot of people would, but then after a week, some people were getting nothing from it. And this new podcast we did, we discovered that you may get more benefit if you're older, not producing as much growth. So I thought, oh, okay, maybe that could be beneficial to me. And some of these people who were older were getting great benefits for like a year off five milligrams. And I thought, well, if I know it's going to work, hopefully, like after one dose, what if I were to use this just intermittently to get like an additional GH boost on, say, an extra hard training day, right? So I have the stuff and I save it and I wait and I take it. And then I woke up five times at night because I was starving. And I forgot how much the appetite would increase. Dude, I like, man, I'm going to go back to that. You know, we've had so many people to ask us, like, what should I take for appetite? Yeah. And I, when I used it in the past, man, it was way back in the day, like when I was eating a ton of food already. So maybe I didn't notice the difference, but, yeah, cool. Dude, dieting and trying to take a tab of MK. Oh my God, man. I was like, okay, I'll just eat a half a rice cake so I can get back to sleep. You know, I'll have a scoop of protein so I can get back to sleep. I probably had like, you know, additional freaking 300 calories, but the time I went to bed and got up. For me, it was always, um, do a little bit of fat when you wake up starving because, you know, it's going to cause you to release CCK, Colitis, the kind in which is going to interfere with the appetite. So you know, yeah, shut down your appetite a little bit better. Yeah. But, um, with the MK, me and Scott did a, we did a call. I want to say maybe six or seven years ago. Okay. And maybe a little less, maybe five years ago. And we, we jumped on Zoom and we were going through studies together, like we do sometimes, like we have done the past about a few things. And, um, maybe there's a phone call and we were looking at studies together, but either way, yeah. I think what we settled on was the best way to dose MK was every other day. Yeah. And maybe he's changed his opinion since then, but, uh, due to like, I think the, like the overlapping and, and like receptor dissensitization, we thought that if you dose it every other day and probably a little bit lower than people typically dose it, yeah, you're going to get a, you're going to get more of an added to benefit than if you're to take like 25 or 40 milligrams every day. Maybe 10 milligrams every other day is going to allow for a bigger boost. Yeah. Yeah. And I, like I said, man, we saw the study that was even five milligrams, but, uh, modern amino had the standard 25 milligram cap. So that's what I got. And I wasn't going to like break it open in the middle, you know, it's like I'm going to take 25, whatever, go to sleep. I did wake up feeling like a million bucks though. Like every time I've taken MK man, I wake up feeling just amazing. I get the best rest, even though I woke up five times, I felt good. I felt that good. Like, like I took Gabba the night before sleep where you feel super like it was a restful sleep, you know? That's the best. Yeah. You ever use Gabba Penton? Oh, yeah. I was prescribed. I've been prescribed. Do you hear that? Oh, yeah. I heard that the skies are open. It was the Lord coming for you. Yeah. It's hurricane season. Yeah. I was going to ask, have you, have you ever tried a mirror background? No, I have one client that's running it though. What do you think about it? Uh, I like it. Uh, and I'm not someone that gets upset about waking up to, uh, my powers went out. I, hopefully my internet stays on. If we lose Andrew guys, you know what happened? Ty's with us. He's, he might be using it. But um, it does help with not waking up to you to have to go to the bathroom. Oh, for sure. Multiple times a night. Like I don't, I don't wake up. I like, actually last night I slept the whole night through, which is crazy. It's in the continents medication, right? Yeah. Uh, uh, relaxes mood muscle tissue like the bladder to allow more urine to build up versus giving you that, that signaling of, oh, I got to go. I got to go. Um, so yeah, you know what? I just realized I am so happy last week. I think I told you I switched to fiber optic. Oh, yeah. That's why my, why my internet didn't go out. My power went out, but my internet is still working perfectly. Holy crap. Your internet's working perfect and you're on a laptop. So you didn't lose the power. That's, yeah, that's that. Wow. So I'm very happy. I thank you frontier, uh, for coming to my house and soliciting me because usually I, I, I usually chase them out the door for coming to my doorstep. But yeah, we're going to get one of those no soliciting signs for that. Very reason. Right. The other thing about mirror bedron is that, um, it also hits, um, your brown adipose tissue. So there's some fat loss pathways there too. Yeah. Yeah. And that's why I think it's, you know, being used lately is for fat loss, but I didn't realize it was specifically focused on brown fat. I believe so if I'm not mistaken. And honestly, zero side effects, you know, I've been using it for two weeks now. And zero side effects. And one more thing I want to say about the slew. Yeah. I do like a five days on two days off. Okay. I feel like you're going to get a longer use out of it. I haven't stopped taking it because it's not like I'm seeing like these added of benefits still, but I'm maintaining a really lean look on next to no other PEDs. And I have to attribute a lot of that to, to the slew, you know, yeah. I'm seeing really good results with right now. I have three guys that are going to be competing later in the season and that they're off cycle right now, uh, preparing to get into their contest cycle. And we've started it already, you know, during this phase of T or T, I think it gives them a mental boost to have that in. You know, you definitely they're getting endurance from it. They're getting positive benefits. And I feel like that's just creating this really great momentum. And we haven't even added an aballax. You know, I think I mentioned a few weeks back, but it's, uh, it's a good place to be man. It's a great place to be when you're looking good and you don't have a lot of gear in you. Yeah. And because you just know, you know, the fullness is going to come back even stronger. The hardness around your training is going to get better. All of it, you know, and then I think you do the same thing where you just, you really try to encourage your clients to get the most out of the least for as long as they can. And then we add the PDs in. Yeah. When, when, when variable stop improving and you're like, wow, that's where the synergy really happens. I agree 100%. Hey, and the mirror background, how are you? Dose in that 50 makes a day. Okay. And do you just take that all at once in the morning or how's that work? Um, I take it when I remember. Okay. It has been in the morning, but you know, for a while there, when I try something new for some reason, I leave it right here by my desk. Right. So I don't end up taking it consistently at the same exact time I take it when I look up and I see it. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's me now. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. It's one of those things where I don't know when it's a new compound, I feel like I want to be able to look at it and I'm going to do some more research on it, you know, as I'm, yeah, as I'm testing it, you know, with you on that 100%. Man, hey, did you have another question? We had a, actually, it was another shout out too, wasn't it? And we had a question. Let me grab this, this photo question about HDL. Okay. And I'm going to open this photo up so we've got it. But yeah, we can go to the HDL question. What was it here? Um, question about lipids. I have fixed my LDL, but my HDL is in the 20s. Um, what have you guys done to raise it that actually worked? I'm already maxed out on a cardio deep in a cut. Okay. Um, well, first, if you say these maxed on cardio, what I would do is, I would definitely switch to hit if he's not doing any hit because that's going to get your HDL boosted more than steady state even. Okay. Yeah. Um, but do you have my picture that I showed you in my labs? Yeah, give me just a minute here. I'm going to pull that up. So guys, you know, not that I'm a heavy user, but, you know, I think I was running probably about a thousand milligrams total PED for, you know, probably several months before this. And then I found out that I needed to get some, some labs done for disability and a new life insurance policy. So obviously I wanted to clean them up and, and get them as good as possible, because your rate is determined on, on your health status, right? So if you look at the top, there's two pictures here, I should have put a line in there, but the, the first pictures from 421, 2025. So April 21st, my HDL was 25. My LDL was 143. Yeah. So not what you want to see, right? And then if you look at the bottom date, 62, 2025, so about five and a half weeks later, my HDL was back up to 46 and my LDL was cut down to 73. What did I do different? Oh crap. I didn't add any different cardio strategies because I was already doing 30 minutes of cardio five days a week. And I've just been maintaining that. And with the slew that I'm taking and the way I diet, I'm able to maintain a nice fairly lean look that way. But I was already using some of your supplements like, you know, citrus bergamot. Dude, I found citrus bergamot to be a, have a really positive impact. Since I haven't run a lot of gear, my, I've been running it long term. And my HDL just sits in like the 40s now, no problem. Really? Years ago, it used to be like, you know, 25 and struggling. Yeah. Whenever I use anything above, let's say 300 milligrams of testosterone, my HDL is what slides. You know, so for me to see a 20, 25 after maybe 10 to 12 weeks of, you know, around a thousand milligrams total of PET. That was normal for me, you know, in contest prep with everything going on. I think I got it as low as 13 one time, you know, a lot of orals. We'll do that too. You're real quick. Orals and some, some AIs and yeah, have a good stuff, you know, but in terms of, like, I have a stack that I use and a lot of my clients will use this when we see poor labs like this. Citrus bergamot, 1200 milligrams, AM and PM, fish oil, three grams AM and PM. Are you, when you say AM and PM, are you saying you'll do three games in the AM and three in the PM or three split? Okay. Just double. Yeah. Sorry. So, so, so three grams with like meal one, three grams with meal five or six. Okay. Same thing with the Citrus bergamot, 1200 with my first meal, 1200 with a later meal. Okay. Carderine, I hit fairly hard at 20 milligrams in the AM and 10 milligrams PM. Okay. Picoginol. I added 100 milligrams, both AM and PM. I don't know that one. French maritime bark. You might know what else. Okay. Okay. Okay. I can't remember exactly what the, it's something similar to like green tea, like the pro-anthoside ins there. Yeah. Okay. Chialic age scarlic, 600 milligrams AM and PM, green tea, two cups a day, and then green tea extract, another 400 milligrams a day. Cortisol, QR, which is a patented form of Picoginol, 600 milligrams a day, and then burberry and 500 milligrams AM and PM. And that was, so that's my stack that I used to basically double my, almost double my HDL and cut my LDL in half in about five and a half weeks. Nice. Now, I don't want to take away anything from the other supplements, but I would be just very curious if you just did the carderine on its own compared to that. And, you know what I mean? I would just be curious because I've seen, let me, carderine on its own, like really ramp it up fast for me. So I can tell you for me personally, carderine on its own does not, um, it works, but it would, it would have brought me back up to like maybe 36 instead of 46, you know? Yeah. But this is a similar stack that I've ran several times when I, I really wanted to fix something fast. Like I wanted to get it done in five, because I remember I did a cycle, I think I told you guys about when I combined, uh, like test, Deca and Tran in the same site. Oh, yeah. And that one really tanked my, my HDL. So I did something similar, but I updated the protocol a little bit to, um, to what I just mentioned a second ago. Nice man. Well, that's, that's like literally, literally like nearly doubled, you know, I mean, that's incredible. I can only imagine, because I'm going to get my labs done in, uh, I think 10 days is when I'm scheduled. And I'm going to be, I, I would love to see if it gets to 50. That'd be cool, man. All right. We got one more thing here and it is a shout out to this one of the guys in the group. I'm sorry. Is all the bodybuilder? Yeah. Yeah. Uh, I saw his pictures in the, in the post. This was actually earlier than when he competed. He competed this last weekend. Um, his name is Anthony James. He's a good bodybuilder in the Northeast. Yeah. Real and, yeah, he won one of the New York shows and I'm sorry if I'm not remembering the name, but he beat another good athlete who's a former client of mine who also is coached by a friend of mine, Mike Naseef. Um, he beat him in the overall and bodybuilding, uh, Josh Matusek, who's also a listener. So both gentlemen looked amazing on stage. They were both in condition. They were both. Uh, so this picture I believe was taken like three or four weeks before the show. Really? Um, so yeah. So he came in nice and if you read the caption, he's, he's, uh, he's doing North Americans this year. And I think he's got a good shot. Um, the Lord's on his side. He just cheered for him. Yeah, yeah, they had the Lord just fucking gave you or gave you some, uh, some thunder buddy. So, um, and I believe he's coached by Justin Justin Jacobi. So they did a great job. Okay. Yeah, his conditioning is outstanding, especially considering like he could go into the show with this. No problem. But three weeks out, man, you know that those glutes got even harder and, you know, look at that. Look at the way his lumbars are sticking out. I know. That's pretty wild. That's pretty cool. If he wants a critique and wants my two cents, you know, I would say he needs a little bit more in that upper back and like the, the Terry's region just to match the poppiness that he has in the rest of his physique. Yeah. I'm nitpicking though because, yeah, you know, when, when he's dried out, that they probably stick out, you know, the, the muscles probably pop out and get even more. Yeah. There's another good one. Yeah, man, this is, this is interesting that we were literally getting to witness Florida, Hurricane right now. What's crazy is it's not even raining yet. Really? No. Go outside and hold your laptop up. And, uh, should I put on my, my tin hat to, yeah, yeah, all that. It'll be, you know, we'll get a good thumbnail for the, yeah, that would be sick. That would be sick. Man, we appreciate you guys tuning in. Um, Andrew, do you have space for coaching right now still? Um, yeah, I mean, if it's the right fit, I'm always open to entertaining conversations with people. It's been crazy busy. I mean, I think I, I've added, I've lost like probably three clients, but I added like seven in the last 10 days. So trying to stay on tap topic, getting new programs. So if I've told you I'm going to get you new program by this weekend, I promise I will. I'm working very hard and diligently. I do have to stop at times to chat with my friends got here and I appreciate you guys. Some great information. I appreciate that. You know, I used to try to like get somebody's program out to them, like same day, you know, because I know like Shelby will do that. But yeah, honestly, I tell people now that I can get you set up in about a week. I usually take Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. I'll have one of those days is usually going to be pretty light for me. Yep. And that's the day I want to do it because I get to like sit back and relax and I get to have fun with it. I think that I'm not taking as many clients as you are. And you know what I mean? So it's like, I'm trying to keep it fun. But I do tell them it'll be like about a week. How long do you usually take to turn around time to get somebody started? Man, it depends. So if someone's like in a prep and they're like, let's say they're in an issue with the coach and they're four weeks out. That's different. Yeah. So I got one of those today that I did. And usually I do ask for a premium on that. I do ask for a little extra. Yeah. Because it means I'm probably pushing off some of my check ins and I'm working to 11 o'clock. Yep. So it's it is like a it's not like I'm just being lazy or I'm just I just want more money. It's like I'm going to be burning the candle at both ends for this and probably my cardio or my training is going to suffer in some way. But usually I tell people, you know, within a week, you're going to get a plan for me. Yeah. You know, and a lot of times I start with just like an intro of like, okay, let me just quickly look at what you're doing. Okay, do this, but change these two things. And then I'm going to give you a more in depth plan that we can really work with going forward. Yeah. Or sometimes if they're already doing something pretty good, you know, you might just need to make those small adjustments. Or maybe we change a few carb sources out or something, you know, but if somebody has a good structure to their plan already, I'm not going to come in. And especially if they already have a good physique, like, you know, inexperienced bodybuilder, I'm not going to tell him like, hey, we need to reinvent this whole thing, you know, I mean, it's that's an easy case. It's also really easy situation when someone has been eaten three meals a day of like Chipotle, McDonald's, and Wendy's. So you're like, oh, this is easy. Let's go for clean meals a day and start there and add a couple steps in. You're going to see progress. The hard ones are where someone comes to you and they're eating chicken and vegetables only. And they're on 85 or 100 mics a T3, high mics a clean, and they're like, my body's stalled. And like, you know, in my shows in four weeks, what do I do? You know, you get those situations. And you got to, like we said earlier in the episode, a lot of times it's a matter of, we got to pull back. And hopefully we have enough time to pull back and then hit your heart again before the show. Or sometimes we just got to pick a different show. Yeah. That's sometimes the case too. Guys, reach out to Andrew at BodyBerry.com. Skip's not with us because we record a couple episodes at once. So he was still at the dentist probably.

And I got to tell you too, man, as much as I love when we have the group together, I like the one on one conversation and I do it's fun. I do. I can kind of pick your brain a little bit more and eat like even the clean thing. I might do not change what I'm doing, but I still love hearing how you do it. I agree. It kind of gets me thinking, you know? For lack of a gate Germans, it's a little more intimate, you know? Yes. You can have more of a real discussion. Yeah. I mean, I like all about it. I like the group. I like one on one. So I like it all. So I look like I'm literally dead. Yeah, you like the lighting. Yeah. The lighting is set up to make me look like dead. Well, I just second there. All right.

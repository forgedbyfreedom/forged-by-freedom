I don't know if they could have been like, it would work for me. So, okay. And everybody's fired. Yeah, yeah, I know it as a job. Yeah, there goes our sponsorships out sucked. So everything's been going really good. I've had a great couple of weeks. I have to say, not like, I want to be one of those old guys that talks about the weather, but we have so far avoided the brutal, ugly heat that we sometimes get in August. It's just snow is up there. But the iglesn, all that. Oh no, we get like, while I could think what you guys would call like, 100 plus days, we get a bunch of those in August, usually, haven't had any yet. We're fucking easy street on easy street, because I hate that stuff. Yeah, you do. So I'm just kind of like this for the rest of the month. You know, I'm hanging in there. How are you guys doing? Fantastic. I'm just amped because we got bodybuilding like full swing. I'm going to my first big show, like national level show in years. Next week I'm going to the North Americans. Oh shit, I haven't been an Aegis man. Oh, I love that show. I don't think I've went since like 15. So it's probably like a decade since I've been and I'm staying in my same hotel that I used to stay when I competed. Yeah, not the host hotel. No, no, no. Okay, oh, I always stayed in the host hotel. Right across the street from cheesecake factory, walking distance to LA fitness, everything I need. Right there. It's going to be like a walk down memory lane, and I love it. I know where to take Tommy for pictures. Nice. So is there a Steelers game going on? You know, I don't know, because I won't be there. So the bodybuilding is Thursday. Friday at noon, I'm catching a flight and going back to Fort Lauderdale for the weekend, because I was like, shit. I'm like, I'm already booked for my flights. And Nikki's like, I want to go to Fort Lauderdale that weekend. I was like, well then change my flights. So there we go. Okay. After the races. Okay. I only ask, I went and bought a PS5. So I've been playing Madden. I've been playing a couple games of Madden every night before bed, just a little, just to the edge of it. Instead of surfing YouTube aimlessly, I've swapped screen time. So less pointless YouTube surfing. And now I hammer out a couple games of Madden before bed. And I am full on like super into football now. Like more than I have been in years and years and years. I'm like, oh, shit. So I, you know, I might do watching all the games now. Yeah, I got my dad's in football NFL football past to watch all the games now. So nice. I don't know, up here we use the app called dad's in and it has NFL on it. And you can like download it and put it on your TV and all that. It's awesome. So who is your team then? I've always been a 49ers fan ever since I was a kid. I grew up with Joe Montana and Jerry Rice, all those guys winning four super bulls. Like when I was a little kid, I was watching the 49ers win four super bulls in the 80s, right? And then when I was a high school, I was like still a Niners fan hardcore. And then they won the 95 Super Bull with Steve Young. So I was still like just fresh out of playing football at that point. I was still a huge Niners fan growing up. So I still root for the Niners. I also root for the Steelers. I always like the Steelers. They were hard kind of old school football, you know? And obviously the 85 bears, I remember watching that game when I was 10 years old, watching the 85 bears destroy the Patriots in the final, you know, with Walter Payton and that whole team, the 85 bears was like the perfect team, you know? Yeah. And so I kind of like those legacy teams, you know, I don't really find myself cheering for like, you know, new new year, I don't cheer for like newer teams. I just, it's always old school guys, you know? Yeah. The Buccaneers to the year the Tampa Bay Buccaneers won the Super Bull was like, oh, two or something. They beat the Raiders. They had Mike Allstad on their team. I was a huge Mike Allstad fan. He's my favorite running back. And so I was a big Bucks fan the year they won the Super Bull there. So then when Brady joined the Bucks and one another Super Bull, I was like, really cool. I was like, oh, this is awesome because I was like the Bucks team. So yeah, those are my teams. I hate it. I was like a Patriot Hater until Brady got like his fourth ring. And then I was like, oh, I'm just being a Hater. This guy's the best. And then after Super Bull five, the big comeback, the 28, three come back after that. I was like fully on board. I'm like, Brady's a goat. Brady all day cheer for like, no, like, you know, eventually you just face reality and you're going to be an effect and Hater, you know? So yeah, that's my football story. I like it. So I started because they screwed up college football, which was the only football I watched. Right. Last season I decided to pick a team. I went with the bills because I have a good team. I chose Alan. Yeah, I like the bills too. And I've got some great data that I picked up yesterday. The average during a game, number of beers consumed across the league, the bills fans win and the average is 8.6 beers a game. Wow. Wow. I feel like those mobbs have having not one in these Super Bulls, I think you need 8.6 beers a game. You do. Alan. Oh, man, I remember those three in a row they lost. Yeah. Like, oh, shit. I remember watching all three of those games with all my friends. You know, giant's Cowboys, Redskins lost, lost, lost. My good friend's mother is like a die hard, like goes to every single event. So now I'm in good company. Like she's had season, you can't get season tickets there. It's like a 10 year waiting list. She's had them for like 25 years. That's funny. I might just find my way to a game now. Anyhow, should we kick off with your great subject, Ron? Yeah. So we thought this would be a good, good topic, posing for your show. A lot of people getting ready for shows right now, posing obviously important. Some of you realize how important it is. I helped one of Justin Chires clients with his shots yesterday. I just met him at West Coast and ran through poses with him. The kid was already on the right. His name's Quinn, Quinn St. Pierre, you can follow my Instagram. Tons of potential, trains hard, great guy. But I helped him with his poses, you know, friend of Justin, the friend ours, right? And she put up that back lot spread. This is five minutes. Yeah, this is a different change. So like sometimes we say you guys work on your posing and it goes in one ear and out the other and you guys think you know what you're doing. But this is five minutes. The same day. Yeah, right? That's just his check in with Justin or whatever and then after I helped him with the pose, he sent him another one. So you know, that's just collapsing with the chest and kind of rounding the back on the one lot spread. And then there's a bit of an adjustment with the legs and stuff too. But then it was just lifting the chest and stretching out the back across his body and look at the difference in the back, you know. So that's what posing does. You know, you can either take two years and improve your back that much or you can work on your real last spread and get it just right. And so like get someone to help you with your posing. Like start early, work your ass off. You know, it's not as simple as just, oh yeah, I got my side chest. Yeah, do you have it perfected? Is your side chest look the best it can look? Like, you're sure there's nothing you can do to make it look better, you know. And you've got to put that effort in and not just be so easily satisfied with what you see in the mirror for a split second. Can you hold that pose for 10 seconds without letting something go? You know, there's so many other things are just thinking you know how to pose. And I'm tired of seeing people think they know how to pose. And then on stage, it's just a slaughter because nothing's nothing's right. You know, they're not really late. Needless to use. Yeah, need, it's stuff. You have something you can control. Yeah. Like you can fix it now. Like imagine if someone said, hey, if you just work really hard at posing, you can save yourself six weeks of dieting. Imagine if someone told you that, wouldn't that be a great idea? Or someone said, hey, you can add 15 pounds of muscle if you just practice your posing. You practice your posing. Like, I feel like the other thing, if you look at these two pictures left and right, notice it looks like he has short legs in a long torso on the left. Like his body actually looks different. And it's very slight. Like he's standing a little taller in the in the better photo. Yeah. It's a little less crouched with the legs, which makes it look more even. Well, and then look at all the, I mean, we, the rear delts are solid in both, but he's got no rhombones on the left. So I guess that's that's that's one week apart, I guess. That's his old check in and then his new check in. So I think that's a big key with that though is he didn't get that much hard. He didn't gain 10 pounds of muscle in a little. No, no, that's a posing change. Like look at the back. It backs. That's just an adjustment right there. And it's something we hammer home. I mean, I've been working with Tommy get ready for North Americans on some little tweaks too, because it's like, I tell my clients the judges judge what you show them, not what you have. Yeah. On the left, he has what he has on the right, but he's not showing it. And that to seek at a top national level show doesn't make the cut on the left. And then he's thinking, oh, I got all this work to do. I'm going to need a year or two to put it back on. The picture on the right is a standout. Right. And it's the same physique. I mean, you just, you can't press that enough on every pose to make sure you bring your best possible package. Plus the other thing is is you should look like you're sturdy, like you're not off balance. I feel like if I were to bump into him on the picture on the left, he would lose his balance a little bit, you know, because you could see his weight's not distributed evenly in his feet even. Right. Whereas on the right, he has planted to the ground, which is allowing his glutes to fire better, his ham fire better and for him to just be comfortable. He could sit in that pose for five minutes if he had to. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just hugely important. And, and, and you know, you don't have to hire someone like I taught myself how to pose. I, I don't quite get why it's so hard to learn to pose. I've said this before, I think my martial arts background actually really helped me because I spent so many years where everything had to be identical, right? Like when I hit this, this, you know, when I did my cotta or my form or, you know, Pumse, we called it an enticuendo, but your form, when you do your form patterns, they have to be identical every time. Like it, like it's precision. That's what they're teaching you. They're teaching you to respect precision and, and memorization and being perfect body position every time. That's what the point of it is, right? It's discipline. It's mental discipline and precision and caring about every little detail. And so when I would do it, like my hand would wind up in exactly the same spot in the air at every moment and my kicks would be exactly the same spot in the air. And so that's what posing is you have to replicate these things over and over and over exactly the same way you just did them. And I think just, you know, where your hands are in space, I learned a lot of that from martial arts. So I get that it might have been easier for me than most people because a lot of people maybe have never done anything like that. But should still be able to see what's going on. Like, you know, they think they're doing the ab thigh. Well, your back legs are not flexed. Right. Yeah. Look, look, look at, look at flex wheeler do it. His other quad is split. So that's what you need to do. Like it, do all of it. Like, so that's my frustration sometimes. Bodybuilding is the only sport that I know of where people don't put the reps into the thing they're going to perform on stage. Because you got to remember like the reps in the gym is to build the muscle. But you know, an NHL player practices his shots over and over and over so that when it comes across to him in a game, it's just second nature. It's like, how many times have you had a client where 50% of the time they hit the shot right and you're just hoping when they get on stage that this is a 50% yeah, come on, get it this time. You don't and you're like, oh, and that's because they didn't nail it to where I just had a guy last week and I told him I'm like, he goes, I get it most of the time. I'm like, well, that doesn't help us. That might not be most of the time. I need you to do it 100% of the time. And if you practice it enough, if you put in the reps, you won't know how not to like, yeah, I got to the point that if someone said like, step your left leg back and say, you're right, I was like, oh, shit. Yeah, like because I had planted the same way so many times, it wasn't even a thought, you know, well, let's let's put it out there, guys. So we're telling everybody that they need to practice their posing. They need to be good at this. It needs to just be not even second nature, first nature. This is just what you do. When should how early into their contest prep should they start posing? How frequently should they work on their posing and how long should they work on their posing procession? Do you want to be really good then you do it in the office? Okay. Yeah, I should already know how to pose now. Because if you can move your body in the off season, hitting it when you're in prep is easy. And then once you're in prep, I mean, to me, you look at it the same way you do training. Yeah, if you're training five days a week, then you're posing five days a week. Yeah, that's, yeah, you should be posing all the time. I mean, I posed at home. I think I ran through all my shots almost every day. At least once. Yeah, almost every day. I mean, off season there would have been days I didn't, but I would always go through them, you know what I mean? And pre contest, I mean, you know, from the day the diet starts, it's absolutely every day I'm going through all my poses. And I'd laugh at this. And how long? How long? Because I, you know, I, because I'm wondering, you know, people are probably watching this at home, maybe they're getting ready for their first show right now. And they're listening to their select, okay, I'm going to be up on this. Is this? Hey, maybe even just five minutes a day at the start. Okay. Yeah, you know, I mean, even just five minutes a day, you know, there's, hey, sometimes five minutes is your whole class. Yeah, right? You also want to be prepared by the end. Yeah, you want to build that. You should go like to me by the end, you should be able to run through all your shots with five second holds, three, four rounds in a row, no problem. Yeah. I tell clients when I was in Arizona, posing your garage, it'll never be hotter than that on stage. Oh, and so if you can, if you can set your setup to where it's harder when you're, when you're doing your practice, then when Steve Weinberg has caught out your shots, you're fine. I mean, Ron talks about it. I mean, he beat Ben Bikolski by practicing posing and eventually, I mean, that's what they'll do. They'll go, these two guys are too tight. Let's just see who dies. Yeah, whose abs shot gets blowing out first, right? Yep. You know, do that to you too at those high levels. So wait for it. I mean, as an audience member, it's fun to watch that. You know what I'm saying? Like that's cool when you get to see that kind of a battle on stage. Yeah, and you start to realize when they're doing it, like, you know, there's been the odd time, we're like, oh, they're just trying to break when these guys love it. You know, and it happens at the very top level sometimes. You know, let's do one more round, gentlemen. One more round. I've seen them do it. Switch sides. Switch sides again. I'm excited to get just to put on a good show. You know what I mean? Yeah, yeah, yeah. They'll do it at the state level here. It's fun because you get the audience revved up. I've been in that a couple times at the state level. It's, if there's nothing more exciting than when you get that moment, you know, unless you're not prepared. I love it. I think that the judge, the head judge, should do a top two or a top three confirmation call out at the night show in the big classes. Just for fun. Like, I think it's, I think that even if it's not crazy close, I think, you know, maybe they'll do the top three then. If it's like the winner's obvious, maybe do the top three confirmation. Yeah. I like it when, when judges, even at the local shows, we'll do that confirmation round at the night show. If it's a big class and it crowds really into it, I think that's great, great for everybody. It's cool. If you noticed last week, and this is something that I like to pay attention to, Jordan Hutchinson shots on his very last round against the, who's he going to, the top three call out? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The top three. It looked at Denner. It looked at Denner. It looked at Denner. Joe. Joe. To the first one. Yeah. Like, he was not going to break. It's like, yeah, I can do this all day long. That's what I've been doing. You know, and when it was him against Q the week before, there was just no fading. I think it's all the way down to the, if you took a side by side of his side, chest, the first time in the last time. It's the same pose. Yeah. If anything, he just got harder. It's the same picture. You just made me think about the strawberries in your, in your, yeah. No, I, I, I agree that not breaking thing. Man, I remember like the day after the show, quite often, my right upper quad would be sore from putting that leg forward and pushing against the floor to actively, you know, and then my right glute and hamstring would be like torched. It got to work out because of all the back shots, you know, and I remember walking through an airport one time with my hamstring and glute on that side. We're so sore because I think dehydration played a role in like making it way worse. I bet. Yeah. And the next day I had like 10 out of 10 doms in my one glute and ham. I was like limping through the airport like, would I tear something? Like I was like that. It was like the worst soreness you can get but day after the show in one hamstring, it was really bizarre. Yeah. Yeah. Just like think of what the, I must have been dehydrated and there's some trauma going on like, you know, so yeah, it's important. You got to be ready for it and be ready to work and you, it's just such a waste when you see somebody like, you know, I, I, I remember having a client who was peeled out of his mind like you're one of those guys where you're like, you got to see my clients glutes. Like I can't even believe it. Like there was like that guy, but he can flex anything. And man, I'm screaming out of my flexure glutes, flexure glutes and he's like walking on stage while he's walking on stage, his glutes are totally shredded. Yeah. Right? Just walking. Yeah. And then when he goes to pose, he just relaxes him and I'm like, flexure glutes. And I was screaming out of him, you know, it's just, I hate that feeling. Yeah. So don't be that guy. What's the follow up on that one's got follow up? I'm going to switch it up, guys. There was a question that you had in your, you put a question box together. We got a bunch of questions. And by the way, so a lot of times guys, we do those interviews like we did with Jordan last week. We don't get a lot of questions there. But you guys have been slightly a little bit. We need you to leave questions on YouTube. Yeah, we need you. We need you guys. And also too, people are leaving us questions over on Spotify. I want to throw it out there to you. Spotify has grown tremendously. Like we are getting not quite as many views on Spotify as we are on YouTube, but like it is frickin' poppin'. So just a heads up. I'm going to start paying attention to the comments over there as well if you guys want to leave us anything. I don't see it offhand, but I'm going to paraphrase. Guy said, it you become the God of the IFBB overnight, Ron and or dusty. What are the three rules, the three new changes that you are going to implement, immediate, effective immediately? Well the first one for me is going to be, promoters are not allowed to have anything but a black backdrop. And they can figure out how to put their sponsors above the athletes because it's really not that complicated. They have these new things called ladders. And we can see them. So we'd start there. What would you do, Ron? I would have cheerleaders for the men's open. This might attach to my current football. You could kind of cross over there. Yeah, they'll cross over there. I'm like, I'm through football, right? Yeah, I'm thinking the NFL has the best sports. They have the best sports product out there. They're the best at marketing their sport and all the big sports. The NFL, they're proven. They make the most money. It's the best business model. They make the most money. They're the most successful. They have cheerleaders. I'm just sayin'. That's the best. They cross over and it's men's open, big event, right? Big money. Got the big fat check. Where are the cheerleaders? I think they should be up and down the aisles between guys. Like guy comes out when he's done his routine and he's walking off stage. They're ring their cheerleaders and they do it like a quick lap through the line. They're jinnin' and then they clear out again. Next guy. I think this would add to the event. I don't know if they really need to be two more changes. I think that one change would significantly improve the experience. He's all set after that. What about if they started with boxing? They had a ring girl who came out and it was like open bodybuilding. She came out with the card. I like the vibe. You'll like the vibe. I like the vibe. I like this. I like the vibe. And it's scantly clad, of course. Yeah, yeah. Of course naturally. Yeah, she's gonna be. Because hey, wokes over. We won. We don't have to do this anymore. Right? We get Sidney Sweeney out there with a halter top. It's a jeans on. She could hold up a ring card. She'd probably love it. Okay. She needs the money. Yeah, yeah. I can't top that. I've got nothing good to add, you know. I told you it's a shutdown. It's a shutdown. The cheerleaders are shut down. That's it. Yeah, we don't need all the background of the stage distracting from the cheerleaders. And really if you have the cheerleaders, you don't even need Bob. No. You need an MC. They can hold up a card or something. Right? Yeah, it's all they need. I need to know what's going on. There was a show this weekend, North Carolina, Golds, Golds, something or another, Golds, Jim, something or another. And they did that. It was all Black background. No, no, they did the Black background though. The other thing. They did that. The less important. But oh, yeah. The less impactful idea that, okay, I got it. Oh, okay. They did that Black background. And it looked good. And they said bodybuilders happy, but yeah. As a member of the crowd. Yeah. I still think the cheerleaders. Like my dad does not care if the background was pink, black. But if they are skantly clad women walking. Yeah. I'm the sport you're in. My worst background. I'll have to find a picture to send you guys. It is. It was so bad. This was in a little auditorium at Wayne State University. I think it was like basically a large lecture hall. And it was an orange, center, black wall behind us. That was in Javall colors. Orange, center, black wall. That's great for physics. With a bunch of orange bodybuilders. Looking up against it was the worst pictures looked terrible. Everything looked awful. Genius. In the fort a sheet. It's perfect. Yeah, perfect. That's how I said I got to go to my buddy in. Oh, who's your buddy? I'm bringing him on. Remember I said, yeah, you know, I know, but I've asked you who's your, who's your buddy, Ron? Oh, Morgan Sharp. Yeah. That pump. Oh, yeah. That pump is here to hang out for a few days. So I got to go let him into my building. And then I'll get back on the show immediately. Ron has his own building, everyone. Yeah. Okay, you too. Coaching is going well. He forgot. He thought that I was actually asking him like I did. You know what I mean? He's like, oh, don't you remember? I told you to show. Yeah, you didn't tell the rest of us. Yeah, exactly, man. So I did see by the way, Jordan was at the range. Now that I'm like I'm following him a little closer. See you and everything he does. He was at the range the other day. So, you know, he's a, he's a man of his word with the Texas. He picked up my, he picked up my, my everyday carry the other day. Oh, he did. Yes. He's a good man. And finally got one. I was like, oh, you're going to love that thing. Good man. I think I know just fits. Just fits. It's good. It's a good fit. Hey, so this question, I'm going to go to real quick while Ron's gone. And I think I know your answer, but I'm curious to hear it. If you had to pick one set intensifier for the rest of your life, what would you pick and why? Now you'd need to do the same one for all body parts. For example, will maker for lateral raises. Rest pause. I do it. Rest pause for sure. I've always, I just, I think it's the best way to pick a weight that you can only do for, you know, 10, 11 reps. And now you're doing 16, 18 reps with the same weight, you know. I think the key with rest pause that a lot of people don't get is make it sure you're managing your time between each attempt. You know, so whether you're somebody who looks and says, okay, 30 seconds, 20 seconds, whatever you're, whatever you do, it's fine. It's to consistently. Yeah. Make sure it's perfect. And the big thing is is make sure you're taking deep breaths during, get that oxygen in, you know, make sure that muscle's ready to rock. But yeah, I love a rest pause. Plus when you're shooting for progressive overload, you really only have to beat one of those to have done it. You know what I mean? So, yeah, that's by far my favorite. What would yours be? Well, real quick, I wanted to also follow that up. When are you in Don't Take Interduce some training again? Well, if I could ever drag him out of California because you know, I don't want to go there. You're not going there. He's not leaving. I've been trying my best to get him to just move his entire operation. But I feel like Newsym's doing a good job with that. So we might get him out of there. Yeah. I would say, you know what I've been into lately is muscle rounds from fortitude training lately. Now, so it's a cluster set, a little bit more complicated to explain, but it's six sets of four reps with a 10 second break between each one. But the thing about this is you only go to failure one time. So with fortitude training, if it's a full body workout each time you train, you're going to do like progressive upper and then like a pump lower. And so for the pump lower, it might be a muscle round. So I can get more volume in while limiting the central nervous system stress because I found like after getting sick that I can I can grow or regrow. I think so. Right. If I get some volume in, but the more times that I hit hard failure, the more times that I'm taxing my central nervous system. So you get in, you know, six sets of four reps. And here's the thing, you just walk it right off the cliff. So there's no like the constant reps. So if you start to fail, like I'm going one, two, three, and then at that fourth one, I fail on, then you're supposed to lower the weight so that you don't fail through the remainder of the set. Okay. So it's that's, it's a little bit different in that way, but it limits how much you tax your central nervous system, which do it, I'll be honest, man, it's not something I used to think about in the past. Like I wanted to know how I could crank it up even more, you know, I'd demolish the central nervous system and then do more on top of that, right? Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. I've actually never done that. Are you doing rest pauses now? Like while you're dieting because you're looking freaking pretty lean from what I saw on Instagram. I'm not really dieting. That's the thing is I just, I just removed daily bullshit. I'm not making them diet. You know what I mean? So we still eat out like I'll still go out once twice a week, but I, I feel like when I post a picture, it should come with like a little thing on the side that says, this is easier when you've had more muscle than this to just maintain. You know what I mean? Because what I'm doing to be as lean as I am and as big as I am would not have ever worked if I was trying to go up. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. I'm four meals a day right now and then one of those little David bars and that's, that's my day. You know, I do 500 grams of rice a day, four slices of toast a day and you know, and then my protein and that's it. That's amazing. Are you adding any cardio to this or I do 20 minutes like five days a week. Okay. And that you like intense cardio too, don't you? Yeah. I like to get on the bike. I mean, it's not like over the intense, but I'll do. You know, seven miles on the bike in 20 minutes. So it's quick, but I'm not killing, I'm watching a movie while I do it. Yeah. You know, so, but it's, it's, it's wild though, how much if I could go back, I would have added intense or more intense cardio in my off season because like we trained legs, yes, they were doing RDLs for the first time I've done them and forever. They had done my set and by the time my two training workers have done theirs, I'm grabbing the bar. Like I don't need any more time. Let's go. You know, I do as before I was like, give me five minutes between attempts on an RDL, you know, I think. Do you say you're training with Turner Ridelson? Yeah, next week. I got, he's going up for North American's too. So we've penciled in a workout or two while we're up there, which I always love. Turner's a lunatic. So we have some fun. You guys know where you're going to work out at? We'll probably just train right across the way at that L.A. fitness because he's got clients that weekend. But it doesn't matter. So what I like about training with Turner is what we'll do is we'll go in the gym and we'll pick a movement. And then I decide what we're doing. And then the next movement he picks and he decides how we're doing it. And we just make sure it's awful, you know, Turner likes to throw in a lot of like, all right, we'll go, we'll get into partials. Now I'm going to hold you into the stretch position, you know, just make every set hell. Yeah. We're going to work it's a different run now. He came back without a hat. He doesn't. He couldn't hear you. There he is. Did you lose your hat, Ron? Oh, he's still on mute too. Yeah. That's right. He sounds better when he says I lost my hat on me. Hey, so it's probably not going to happen because there's like a thousand one way streets and bridges and everything else to try to navigate your way through Pittsburgh. But if you get a chance, check out exercise warehouse. That place is the bomb. And they've got some old equipment you've never seen in your life. And when you find it, you're going to wonder why you never trained on it before. No way. Oh, I might have to. If he's got a space, because all we need is like, you know, an hour to train in the drive. So if he's got like a, just client, just eight, maybe we could head over and get an hour work out and come back. It's good. They have like, I think upstairs, they have like old wood plank floors. So you're kind of like creaking on the, on the floor. Oh, my joints are all by themselves. Yeah. We're good. Yeah. I don't even know what's happening. I remember I saw Seth Feroci there and it was right after Brett Wilkin had gotten his pro card. So he was Brett Wilkin was still like, you know, 210 pounds at the time. Yeah. Yeah. Turn pro and classic. And they were getting the worker up there. Yeah. That's funny. We were like the only, the only three or four people in the whole gym. So what's up, man? What's up, Ron? Hey. Oh, we got Morgan in the house now. He's meeting the new dog and hanging out. Brought his laptop up. He's going to do some work for a few hours while they get his room ready. That's why he's hanging out at the house. Okay. So he came out to just hang out and train in Vancouver, all that. Yeah. Came out to train at West Coast Iron with me. We're actually also going to get a workout in at the compound. Oh, yes. I'm going to go train at Braden's place because Morgan's been out here several times. Like he's been coming out ever since we opened West Coast, you know? Yeah. And he's never had a session at Braden's house. So those of you that know my training partner has a sick home gym, like just a few blocks away from my gym. So we're going to go have a chest and bicep day at the compound today. And then we're going to do legs at West Coast tomorrow. So it'll be, we're all in. Yeah, be good time. You know, it's extra great about Braden's gym. And I didn't, I didn't really realize this until I saw post a video the other day on Instagram, all the equipment, obviously, that makes the gym. But having the front garage door and the back garage door that you can open both there is right. Yeah. Yeah. That's nice. Oh, yeah. So the door is open and it's funny. We were training there. We had four of us in there the other day. And you know, like couple of them, you know, Braden and Big Mic are getting ready for shows, right? Yeah. So they like had their shirts off. Like we were training adults and they're just training shirtless. Yeah. You know, like what do you know old school home gym workout, right? And you know, I had to sleep the shirt on. We're all pumped. My, you know, Jack, my buddy, Jack was in there. He says arms out, you know? And we look up and there's these little kids standing at the end of the driveway, just staring into the garage. Like this group of kids, they were like, like, you know, like 10, 12, 13, like that old. This group of them sitting at the end of the driveway, just staring into the garage from like, you know, it's about 60 feet of driveway to the garage. And they're just like, what is going on in there? And the loud rap music was pumping out. Like old school rap pumping out. And they would have just staring like, that's the world. I think you inspired the next generation, man. Oh, yeah. I hopefully sent a few of them home a little bit different. Yeah. I changed forever. You know, they're vision of what they want to live. Yeah, yeah. You know, the parents would be like, I don't know what happened, but he became obsessed with being big muscle eats and eating more. And oh, I don't know what happened. I know whose fault this is. Three, four years is going to knock on that garage door. Yeah, they're ready for a membership. I'm ready. Yeah. They've seen out of a movie, right? I'm coming back. I'm ready. Oh, my God. Did you guys see, I think I sent it to you. There was a video on Instagram of a guy who was like, he was like the home gym, like the big guy in the neighborhood, the alpha of the neighborhood. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. New guy walk. Oh, that was so hilarious. Yeah, the new guy in the neighborhood is jacked. Yeah, yeah, that was funny. Maybe more jacked than the jacked guy in the neighborhood, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's funny. It heads up the Heybro nod. Yeah. I remember the Heybro nod, like it goes all the way back to like the very beginning. Like I remember being like a, I remember being a 17 year old bodybuilder, right? With like grill aware sweatshirt on and give you chimpanzee. And my parents had like, take me out of town for a wedding to go to someone's wedding. So I'm in some town somewhere. I don't know anybody, you know? And I go to the local gym and it's just all like super normies like 1991, you know, like just, you know, an old man reading a book on the app machine and just like just normie city. And then there's one dude. You look across the room and he's got like a team Michelin. Yeah. And he's doing shrugs and he looks at you and just. Sup, bro. Sup, bro. Nothing else needs to be said. You know, at that point in time, the world was the bodybuilding world was so small. And you just see one other member of it. You'd be like, oh, I'm not alone. And if you need a spot that day, you know, you know, go over. Hey man, you want to spot me on Lake Press? No problem, you know, what was his name? And then your of course your wife's like, what was his name? Like, I don't know. I don't know. You know, I've had people in my own gym that I've been nodding to for a year or two. And it's, Nicky's like, what's his name like? I never asked. I don't know. Is he married? I don't know. I don't know. What's he do for a living? I don't know. He's got great ones though. Police, yeah, probably spot me on the pull down without taking too much. I know that. I saw a fantastic video. It wasn't about bodybuilding, but it reminded me of just, just how things are. It was a woman. And she was doing a rant video on how she thinks it's just insane that guys can just roll up to the park and play pickup basketball with other men that they don't know. And it just all works out. And everyone has fun. And then there was like a dude reacting to it. Like he's laughing. He's like, she's like, they just make friends. They don't even know their names. They just all of a sudden coordinate teams. And it just happens. And they follow the rules. And no one, no one like tries to undercut anyone or back to like, and the guys like, yeah, it's just chill. We're just playing. It just laugh it as aso. And she's like, I would be a wreck. I would be like, I get to get these people to like me. Do I bring muffins? Do I have to? Do I have to? Like, just roll up to the park and walk up. It is roll up like, hey guys, who's next? You know, me, you, we're next. We're team three. We got three, three. Good. We're good to go. And I just thought it was so funny. I was like, yeah, that's how guys are for sure. You know? Oh, here's a good one from Dusty's list. What's the shortest off-season push that you guys have done or done with the client? And here's the big caveat. And made good progress. Oh, geez. Like 18 months. Yeah. Jordan, somebody, we were none of them were, I don't think I ever had one that was long enough. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, I was going to say the flip side of that is sometimes, you know, some of my best show looks were on the backs of terrible off-season. Right. Because that happens too. You almost get that like slingshot prep, you know, where you, you know, you've been, you know, like banged up and had a shitty off-season because something hurt and so you weren't even really cranking. So your body's kind of fresh. Look at Jordan last week. Yeah, like Jordan, right? You know, like you're kind of fresh because you weren't really cranking because you were, you know, couldn't really push. And you're, you know, you stayed a little lighter because you couldn't really train hard. And you know, you've favoring your knee and your elbow and your shoulder for four, five months straight. You've had that happen and then you wind up yielding a really great stage look because you were fresh. So it's kind of funny how it works. And then sometimes you get those crazy off-sens really like, comment, this is awesome. But I've also felt like that was kind of like a hard slug. Like I went hard all year and then I went hard all crap and you're like, oh my God. Yeah. How do I get into this? So I don't know. It's kind of funny to look at. It's not always how you wind up on stage. Obviously everyone wants a great off-season though. But, you know, I mean, you need at least several months to make any significant changes. I think that's the biggest thing to look at is in my opinion, I hate when somebody puts up two photos. Let's say they're a good bodybuilder. And they're like progress from last year to this year and I'm like, which ones last year? I'm looking and I know bodybuilding. They're a great shape in both and you're like, hmm, I always felt like I should be able to put up two photos and hand them to somebody who doesn't know and say, which one is better. Right. And they can just go, that one is. And that to me is the sign of a proper off-season. I mean, to me, I ask my clients, don't be in a rush to step on the stage the same. I want at least a year because a year, we got to pull 16 weeks out to diet. And I want eight months. And that's not a lot of time if I want to see them put on 10 pounds. So that's a tight window. I do think that we all have those. Everyone has a year or two in their bodybuilding career. They look back and go, I don't know what happened between here and here, but I became a different person. For me, from 2010 to 2011, I put the picture side by side and everyone, what did you change? I'm like, nothing. Yeah, yeah. It was just one more year and for whatever reason, everything fell into place. So my answer is a year is the perfect timeline. And yes, I've had clients make drastic changes in four months and get on stage again. But all that tells me is, what could we have done with eight months? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, so I still don't advise it. I'm just like, well, that was awesome. But maybe next time we can go longer. Yeah. I never had a short bounce back and all the sudden things looked awesome. It was always my longest ones. And I think that goes to show like genetics, right? Like the longer I took between shows, the more progress I would make, the shorter. I'll tell you what, though, with the shorter, I feel like it's easier to get leaner when you, it's like I just was lean last year. You know, you don't get a chance to get too fat. You get a few. You're a show every year, you know? You take two years and you might have a little bit more work to do, you know? The one thing I did find on accident, which I could never replicate because I didn't have the discipline, but I got some of my best gains because one year I had a surgery that put me out for like two months. And I was like, all right, I'm out. But what ended up happening was when I came back to train all the little niggles that I wouldn't even call injuries, just annoying little things were gone. He took the rest for the day. And then when I started training, I blew up and I always told myself, all right, after this year's show, I'm going to take six weeks completely off to rest and I'll be better and then like a week and a half later, I'm like, you know what? A week and a half is pretty close to six weeks. I know. I think we should get back to it. It's like, if you look back like Ronnie used to do that. I think he said two or three months, all three months off. Yeah. Every year. You train nothing. So there is something to be said about stepping completely away. And I hope that you're a better man than I and you can actually do it because I couldn't. I love to train too much. Yeah. I remember us hearing all those stories of Ronnie not training for two to three months after every Olympia. And it wasn't like the Kevin LeVron legend because that was like six months. Yeah. Like, you'll prep start. Yeah. And partying. Yeah. It was just like, just, you know, was that home with the family? Yeah. Home, you know, and, um, and, and you wonder like, man, maybe, maybe that's why he can, maybe that's, maybe that's part of the reason why, you know, we were all thinking like, maybe his wife is so big, like, ah, can't be. And he's going to jail because like we were just, ever, I just felt like in my, my group, my years of my sort of era of coming up, we were also desperate to not get left behind by what was happening. You know, that was a crazy time when everyone was getting really big. Like I was, you know, I was bodybuilding in the 90s and it was just an arms race to get as big as you possibly could. Like every year someone else had gotten huge, you know, like Dorian, Dorian stepped up all the sudden and won the O and now it's like, oh shit. And then like, Nasser came and got way bigger suddenly because Nasser wasn't that big when he turned pro. He was big. And then he got humongous. And then like everyone started getting bigger. Kevin's stage weight went up 20 pounds and you know, everyone is just, it was that era where you're just desperately trying to not get left behind by what was happening. And the last thing we would, we would like think would actually be a thing would be taking three months off the gym. That makes perfect sense. You know, every month away from getting bigger to get bigger. So we just all chucked it up to Ronnie, being Ronnie. We're like, oh well, whatever. He's doing, doesn't matter, right? It doesn't count. So, you know, for us humans. Yeah, yeah. What about this one? Okay. So this is going to Vegas for the first time this year. I assume he's going to the, oh, name three things to avoid and three things that you have to do in Vegas. Thank you, gentlemen. Well, so if I try to think of someone who hasn't been to Vegas 30 plus times, you know, that changes your list, right? It makes you sort of jaded. If I was like, how old is this guy? He doesn't say. Okay. Well, if I was a, you know, a young guy going to Vegas for the first time, I would recommend you start. I don't. I don't. Okay. I wouldn't, I don't care anymore. I'm older, but I would, we used to love going to Vegas strip clubs. Okay. You know, the Vegas strip club, the Vegas strip club was at least one. One time we're going to strip club. That was just a fun thing. I was going to the strip club, have some fun. There's just nothing like a Vegas strip club, you know what I mean? So that was always something I told the guys to do. I'm like, I got a strip who wants to Vegas. Who wants to go anywhere else? Yeah. Like, I don't know. I heard Miami's good though, but I'm just saying I'm not a strip club guy, but I heard the Vegas strip club was, you know, I recommend that. I'm going to tell you guys something. You might not believe this. I have never, once in my life, ever, not even kind of been to a strip club. I've never been to a strip club in my life. Wow. Yeah, never have. I mean, I'm not going to say you're missing anything drastic, but it's just interesting that you haven't done it. I mean, I've heard all about it while my friends told me about it. And I even had a friend who was like, yeah, this is what you do when you go there. And, you know, he was like, in fact, he had an angle. He was like, when you go to the strip club, you don't show any interest in the girls. He's like, you don't even look at him. You just talk to your buddies. You just don't even pay attention. His plan is how to have sex with a stripper. This is how it starts. Probably not the best goal. Yeah. You don't even look at girls. You don't treat them with any respect or anything like that. You don't even care. They don't even exist in your mind. And when they come over to you, it's kind of like they're bothering you. Like that's that's his angle. And then before you know it, like then they're working for his attention. It's basically he was like, it's a, it's a very like a always sunny, Dennis type of routine. It's not wrong. Yeah. But she will have sex with you because of the implication. The implications. I don't like the way that sounds. That sounds really dark. Yeah. Oh, you must be misunderstanding what I'm saying. The girls said no, then the answer obviously is no. No, but the thing is that she's not gonna say she would never say no because of the implication. I love that I know that what I'm like, oh, that's so great. No, no, what I'm saying. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's the best. Sorry. Took us to what's the hotel that the that shows that now the resorts world. Right. Yes. So one place you have to go is Tacos El Gordo right across the street from Resort World. It's, I don't know if it is, but it sounds good. I want that. You walk in that place. It's open all night. It's open all day. Like everything doesn't matter. When you go in there, there will be 60 people in line to get Tacos. And it is a madhouse and it is amazing. Good enough that after we went last trip, we went back the next day. It's a life changing emotional experience. Tacos El Gordo, you're welcome, everyone that goes, tell my sent you, it won't mean shit, but I'll feel good about it. Okay. Yes. That place is a must. Things to avoid. Thinking that the next hotel is walking distance. Oh. Very important lesson does not have the floor. There's no, there's no, we'll just walk down there. Okay. I always love watching New Vegas people. You see them and they're like in the hotel breathing hard. You're like, where'd you walk from? And they're like, just two hotels away. I'm like, so four miles. Yeah. Because it's just over there. You guys would know something. I enjoy that. I like the walk. I do because you see all sorts of stuff. And if you do it properly, stuff and things, stuff and things, you can walk through the hotels and kind of find your way through a maze that will lead you to the next one. And then you can continue doing that. And so inside the air conditioning. I remember. I use a similar maze called Uber. Right. I remember my first Olympia. We were staying at the Mandalay Bay. Yeah. And I was like, oh, I got to go check out Fat Burger. Because we didn't have Fat Burger in Canada yet. OK. So I was like, I got to go to Fat Burger. And everyone's like, yeah, it's a few blocks down in strip. Like, I don't want to walk to Fat Burger from the Mandalay Bay. And on a map, it's like, yeah, that's only this far. Yeah. And then you walk there from that hotel and you realize that you made a huge mistake. Yes. Yes. You've made a critical, critical error. Yeah. Yeah, that's a cute. I also would say if you haven't been to a Vegas show, you should go to one. A good Vegas show. I've been to all of them. But I still don't get bored. So the one we went to was great. The illusionist and the mentalist and the illusionist. That was like totally at my alley, you know, because I've seen like a couple of circus o'lays. And it's like cool. I was much more entertained by the mentalist and the illusionist that that show was fantastic. We left our brains broken. Yeah, yeah, broke our brains. Yeah, really, really great show. So but you got to see something if you appreciate that. And then also to absent the show absent it's users. It's outside in a small tent. It's one of the best shows you're ever going to see in Vegas. It's super off the wall and just amazing. And you got it. I would highly recommend absent. It's one of a bunch of awards like, you know, people, it's like kind of a smaller show. So people kind of goes under the radar, right? But you got to go see it. It's awesome. If he's going for bodybuilding, I assume this is like he's going for the Olympia. If you want to do the whole thing, you can go to like, there's the meat, the Olympians, there's, you know, there's free stuff. Like stuff that you can do that doesn't cost you any extra. I mean, obviously the Expo costs and he already knows about that. I'm sure. And then there's the press conference which, you know, it's like if you, it's kind of cool if you've never seen it before to see that in person. You know, well, it's not going to be like a change your life thing, but you do get a chance to kind of see everybody and hear them talk. So I'd say if you've never done that before and you're a fan of the sport, go to the press conference and check that out. I used to go to the press conference every year. That was a big deal. I thought that was a lot of fun. That was like the warm up for the weekend though. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're like, get into that. All right. We're here for the Olympia mode. Also the Dragon's Lair sets up at the at the resorts world now. They set up like an outside, an outdoor gym. Yeah. That's cool. So that's a great way because you do not want to try to walk into the Dragon's Lair during the Olympia week. Was that bad, huh? I don't know if you actually want to train. If you want to see people, great place to go. If you want to get a workout, don't do it. One month before hanging out there, hit that spot. What other gyms? What other spots are there? Don't put a hide in Iris' gym because she's nuts. I sat Scott. You know where the plates go on the side of a leg press where all the plates are? Yeah. So we're waiting at a photo shoot and I'm sitting on top of the plates. Yeah. Just waiting and she comes over and she says, can't sit there. I'm like, okay. She's like, you'll break it. I'm like, this is literally its job. Yeah. It's to hold weight. And I was like, I now understand why this gym is quiet. Okay. You own it. That's me leaving my unbiased opinion that's not too direct. I literally was like, I would never walk through the doors of this gym again. That's your non-Google review, Dusty. Yes. I should leave a review. But anyways. I remember I went to, I can't remember which powerhouse it was, but it was one of the power houses. I was staying at an Airbnb a little bit away from town and I ran into a crew of bodybuilders there. I was in Johnson. He was there with, let me think Ian Vellier. So he had Ian was there. I just interviewed Ian for the first time. Ian was brand new. It was like his first idea. I'm trying to think who else was there. I remember Roman Fritz was hanging out with them. What's her name? Who gets absolutely freaking peeled female bodybuilder. Super short. You love her, Dusty. Oh, my Kayla. Yeah, my Kayla was there. Oh, my Kayla. I'm a Christian Melissa. I'm a Christian needed from a Kayla. It's super short. Oh, okay. And it was like before they were all like super big and I was like, hey, I'd really love to get you guys both on the show. And they're like, oh, yeah, that'd be cool. We had like a little two second powwow, you know, five minute powwow after they were done training. I kind of, I started talking to one of them and the other couple other, you know, they walked over and stuff. So, but then it, you know, I just never got that to happen. Yeah. That was a couple LVACs by the way there. Yeah, you get into and get really good workouts that have awesome. I don't know what the where the one is that's got like the eighties lights on the walls and so the LVAC on Maryland Parkway is still teal and purple. Yeah, that gym is awesome. If you like day, hit that gym. Got a bunch of old school legs and great gym. I know you will see people. You will see people, but you'll like, I used to when I was, when I was still like in it, I always train those weekend. Yeah. So, I get in there like six in the morning. Yeah. And sure as shit, you'd see the four or five other people in there that needed to get their workouts in and you get a nasty workout on great equipment. And the rest of the gym is just the people who train there. So it's, it's not nailed down like the other ones because obviously I mean, who doesn't want to go flex his gym right to see it. But if you need to train, hit that. It's awesome. And then I met Dusty at that gym that was like way out of town. Oh, yeah. What was that called? That little small one. It said underground. It said hardcore gym on the, on the sign. Yeah, I can't even remember, but it was real small. Jay used to go out there. Yeah. Yeah. Like little paintings on the wall. Oh, they had that mural on the wall of the wall. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That was a deal. I was right in the wall and a bunch of people. Yeah. Yeah. And that, so you will, you will run into people no matter where you're at. You might actually be able to talk to people in a place like that versus the wall to wall of right down there, you know. Plus if you want to see like, you know, guys like that truly training, then you need to go to all the gyms and you're going to watch how that guy or girl actually trains versus them trying to manage a pump workout before, yeah, the expo. Yeah. Lots to do in Vegas. Lots not to do in Vegas. Just know it's going to be really expensive, like everything. You know, when I look at my credit card bill after, it's like $25. $25. $35. $50. $50. $25. $100. You know, just in that space this morning. I just look at it. That's the key. Yeah. See when I look at my credit card, everything's been converted to Canadian. Oh, yeah. So numbers really bigger. So I'm like, you know, they'll say like, you know, say like, you know, steakhouse, $175. Yeah. Like, what are you? Fuck. And I'm like, oh right, my bill was 100. Right. Right. Like, you know, it's painful for you. Yeah, it's painful because everything gets magnified into Canadian dollars. I'm like, you know, I bought a milk, you know, buy milkshake for $7. And now my credit card bill is $12. I'm like, what about a $12 milkshake? Plus a $2 milkshake. Plus a $2 milkshake. Plus a $2 milkshake. I'm on top of that. That'll hit you. That'll hit you. You're credit card hits you one more time. Yeah. Yeah. $18 milkshake. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Don't try to eat your usual egg white consumption in Vegas also. Hopefully. I'm on a $50 egg white bill because I've tried to buy the egg white. Yeah. It's literally per one. It's like $3 per egg white. US. Yeah. Yeah. If I go again, I'm bringing food, at least for the first part of the weekend, that way I have food available to me that's clean and I paid for it at home. That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to extend. I'm going to do that. And I'm not going to. Yeah. I'm going to bring a couple of meals and then the rest will just be expensive restaurant balls. Yeah. And then the rest of this is hanging out with me and wish you didn't. I'm not gaining weight this year, Dusty. Hey, guys, what was the most difficult thing that you had to figure out how to improve during your bodybuilding career? Caves and arms. Caves and arms. And I just, my calves finally just grew from a battle of attrition. Like, I beat them into submission. My calves grew and I trained them three times a week, which is like something I, you know, I was like really dogmatic about the Dorian stuff in the first many years of my career and the training and I was like afraid to train things more frequently because I thought, well, they won't recover. You know, like, I'm training things so hard with like all the like heavy weights and, you know, partial wraps and I'm bombing the shit out of stuff I need to recover. But when I finally gave up on that and just started training my calves more often, they finally grew. And I got to the point where I had like okay calves that like no one mentioned, right? They were good, but they just were bad. No one mentioned them like they were just, they were okay. I was glad by on them. They were okay. So I did okay. But, and then arms was like a little bit of that too. Like, I had to just train them a little more often, you know, I started adding a, you know, some pump, like some pump sets on chest day as well as my arm day. And then even on shoulder day, I do like a few sets of extensions and then same thing for biceps. And they finally kind of grew when I did that. I got my arms to the biggest day I ever got them. So, you know, I don't know, you know, what I should have done early on if, you know, what had changed things a little bit, I might have, you know, been better. But yeah, that's how I got those things to kind of eventually happen for me. Yeah. I mean, I've answered this a million times on the show. So, most already know, but I had to throw out the idea of progressive overload on my biceps. Yeah, arms that just started training. Yeah. I had to just squeeze them and make sure my shoulders didn't get involved. I mean, to this day, I train lighter than most men in the gym on biceps. I just have to. There's a few things. Fortunately, like, AJ has equipment that is so good at locks you in a position and then I can just grip and rip. But if I'm doing like a barbell curl or dumbbell curl, a 35 pound dumbbell is like, that's kind of my peak. I'm good to go. After that, I can move it but it's not the bicep. And then the big thing that I would say is like Ron was saying about being dogmatic is even things that are going well, just make sure you're watching them. Right. You know, like, is what I'm doing making a muscle grow? Because it doesn't have to be a weakness for you to pay attention that other things are pulling away. I started bodybuilding. I was all legs from hockey. And then a few years in the bodybuilding, I'm looking, I'm like, I'm killing myself on legs, but my upper body is bigger than my lower body. What do I need to do? And I had to just look at what I was doing and say, okay, this isn't working. Yeah. And one at a time, start stripping things away to find a way to get them to lock. And I think the thing I ignored that I pushed to guys now and it's one of the reasons I ask about what sports they played in the past is, my legs could handle volume. I skated every day twice a day, three times a day for the majority of my life. So one workout of low volume wasn't enough. So I, again, threw the rulebook out the window. It's like, okay, we're going to do high intensity and high volume and do it twice a week. And all of a sudden things started shifting. At one point, Dante had me in the gym train legs three times a week. Right. And it wasn't playing nice. I was knocking the shit out of them every time. And it breaks all the rules, guys talk about, oh, what were you sore when you went into train legs? I'm like, I was sore every day for seven months. Let's just look at what this is how dusty looks now. This is like very impressive dusty. Yeah, holding this. That's a, that's a very impressive. Yeah, you look so stressed. Yeah, you still got everything, you know? So whatever you do and now to hold everything is working. Well, we talked about his diet while you were away. It's not that impressive. Not the food. I know. A complete lack of food doesn't make sense. I think that that's a factor of what Dante told me forever, which is just when you've held size for so long, for me to get under 270 is like, I have to actually diet. I think I was like 268 in those pictures. Yeah. And that's eaten out a couple of times a week, eating four meals a day. But the big thing is is everything is the same every day, just like bodybuilding. Yeah, you know, I mean, my meals are the same. And I don't know how people, like, I don't know, you know how people, your clients will say I'm so bored of eating. I don't want to think. I just eat because I'm like, I'm hungry. Yeah. And now I'm not hungry. Mission accomplished. Right. You know, like, I've had taco meat in rice every day for like two years straight, at least once a day. Yeah. And I'm like, I'm crazy. I'll just do that again, you know, 93 seven never fails me. So I think that goes right back into consistency. And then muscle does not want to go away when you've had it for a long time. Yeah. Isn't it so perky, buddy? You can tell you're ready to lose and I got to starve myself like you did it. Yeah. I'm 238 right now. Yeah. And it took you years of making your like starving plus he still trains hard. He could have sped it up, but he can't give up the gem, which neither can I. No, no, I still like to train. So that's that's part of it for sure. But you ever want to know why I eat a pizza and I'll be 244, you know, so we're going to send him home at 250 for me. No, no, no. You eat what I eat every meal. Let's go. I don't know what will not happen. We have a physique critique from Patreon and I was going to get it on with you guys. So you think here, let's go to his Instagram here and Chris. I don't like it too much hair. Chris, it's got some good pictures here. I figured this would be a good place to go. Why is it always the guy that looks like this that wants a critique? I know. I know. Right. That's a. So, what's he? Wow, look at that. He says that on the left that's made of August, it's one pound difference. I love that the scale means nothing. Yeah. Well, he's got some quads, you know, he's got some quads, he's got good Z-taper. Oh, that glutes are coming in. I want to see blurry on my screen. Oh, you know what? I think I went to the whole second. Here we go. We're all about in place here. There we go. I was waiting to see if he had a back shot. I was like, yeah, but wait till he turns around. Oh, it's pretty good. It's a good. Yeah, like how far out is this show? See, I started prepper roughly the same weight I am now. It doesn't start. We can do the show. Yeah. I mean, he's doing a pretty good job, man, you know? I mean, what's more critique on is just where he's at? Like, what does he need to improve? You know, I think that's a real... So I'm not going to critique his condition at all because I don't know how far out he is. So it doesn't, it's irrelevant. But I will say, like, it looks like he's dieting hard and everything's coming in. So, I mean, I mean, he's on the path to getting ripped. I mean, the glutes are coming. So like, there you go. See, the glutes are pretty tight. So he's doing a great job. So aside from condition, which is like I said, coming along really well, you know, just needs mass. I mean, I don't really see anything glaring, like, you know, he's got quads of E-taper from the front, you know? I mean, everyone needs bigger arms in the front double. I mean, that's not even a unreasonable thing to say. See the back shot? All right. You know, most guys need more back. You know, he could use... I mean, who can't handle a bigger back? Right. Everybody's a bigger back. He's generally pretty balanced. Like, I guess his arms could be bigger for you. He's got big delts. He could handle some bigger arms to match his delts and the back could come up. I'd say he's got pretty big shoulders. He doesn't really want to worry about that right now. Yeah. And everything else just kind of size up. Like, you know, I mean, again, the calves could use some more meat on them. So hammer the shit out of those and... Look at the difference in his traps in the left to the right. Yeah. Like all the traps. Even that lower trap. It's like they just stung by a bee or something. So something like... He's on the right track. But I would say... Right gear. Yeah. I would say bring the... He'd say bring the arms up and the back up and, you know, just size up, you know, through the back of the legs and a little bit more mass. But like, there's nothing glaring sticking out. I'm not like, oh, the guy's got no quads or anything like that, you know? Right. That's really helpful. Because that's like, that's the worst, right? You're just missing something. Like someone has no arms or no doubts or like, it's just hard. Because how are you supposed to be good at bodybuilding when there's really something missing? So good X-Frame too. Like the X-Frame's great, you know? I was trying to, you know, focus on the positive stuff. He's not missing anything and he's got a good frame. Yep. I would say, can you show me the side chest real quick, Scott? There you go. So the delto bit. So the delto big. Yeah. You see the, you see like his biceps are stronger than the tries in that shot. And the reason I pointed out is if you go back to the rear double, he needs to get his, twist his arms back further because I can't see his biceps in that rear double. Okay. Especially the right one. Right. That's a quick tweak to your posing where the arms you have now will be bigger. Yeah. You know what I mean? Because you gotta remember the judges are below you guys. And when they're looking up, if that arm isn't twisted back far enough, they're looking to your same pure biceps. Yeah. And you should just kind of roll it back a little bit. Yeah. Just a little bit more to get those biceps to pop in there. And everything else like you were saying, Ron, if somebody that looks this good is missing a body part, I almost don't want to tell them what to do because I'm like, I know he's doing everything because he didn't train the rest of his body to be that good and be missing it. Right. Whereas in his case, it's all there. I think what he needs is, you know, one more year times three, you know, each year get a little bit better and smart, you know, because I mean, the difference in those two shots are nuts. And that's from May to August. Yeah. Right. Like, you know, so just just keep doing what you're doing longer and understand that like we were talking about earlier in the show, one year, you're going to have an enormous jump with no reason that it happens so drastically. But there's nothing missing that physique where I'm like, oh, he needs XYZ movement to get his, yeah, you know, back, thick or whatever. I think you just need more time. And I would highly suggest do not start trying to think of what you need to change. I think you just need to keep doing what you're doing longer. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Go with all the, I don't have anything to add to that honestly, guys. I feel like that was a pretty good, pretty good analysis. And yeah, you're right, Ron. It's always those guys that want the critique. You know what I'm saying? Guys that are already pretty good. Yeah. If you don't know, you're good. I got news for you. You're very good. Yeah. The only thing I would say is I find sometimes guys that have really big shoulders, like big delts, front delt rear delts side delt. And they need a little more back or chest. They just have to be a little bit cognizant to like, you know, not just, not be pulling with their rear delts a lot and not missing with their front delts a lot. That's what I would do to say. But just going to make sure you're aware of that you're not doing that. So my rear delts always wanted to take over for me. And then you see the guys too, same thing with like guys that have like really crazy biceps, but they don't have a back, you know, their biceps are pulling. Yeah. I've even had someone where I told them I'm going to stop training rear delts. Like don't even do rear delts. Actually, yeah. You don't need them because your high row, like their elbows out, like upper back row that have as your rear delts fine. They don't need to waste any time training. They're plenty big because they're rear delts on this guy that I was talking about. He's like, was like the biggest muscle on his back. Yeah. So it's like stop training them because he did them all the time, right? Yeah. You don't need to train them. They'll just stay that size because of your rows and then you can get your back to catch up. Yep. So wonderful. Great physique though. Anything else you guys wanted to make sure we tackled? I mean, I feel like this week there wasn't like a lot going on in bodybuilding. You know, there's no big shows. There's no crazy news, nothing. Nobody said something about somebody that not that we do that kind of content, you know, but right, right, right. No, I'm happy. Somebody of we had to talk about it. I'm happy Paul got his channel back. I know that. Oh, yeah, yeah. He didn't talk about it, but that's great. That's great news. You know, I talked to him. I said, yeah, where everyone was afraid they were next, you know? Yeah. Yeah. He thinks he just got mass reported. Yeah. It happened. Yeah. Which is cool. You know, yeah, for sure. Yeah, we were all worried, you know, a little bit. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. You know, they come in for us. Hey, I want to give a quick shout out to you to a couple of my people that I was working with. They, I had a guy who was going into the masters and at a, at that Golds gym show in North Carolina. And he won the Masters Division in Classic. And then he was absolutely excited that he took, I believe it was fifth place. Out of 12 guys in the open. He was like, I don't even think he was going to do open it first. I was like, nah, you got to do open since you're going to come in. Absolutely. Like, I'll throw a picture up later, but he came in really good. And a hard worker guy did like everything that I could ask in, I mean, oh, your hand was 25 milligrams of windstroll. That was it for the last three weeks. That was literally all the gear. He is peeled. So I want to say that so that when you guys see this conditioning, you realize it's not all the gear. And then the other guy completely natural because he's 16 shout out to Cade. He, you guys he killed it, man. He didn't complain once. We went all the way down to a protein fat. We reduced the protein. We reduced the fat. Like he got an incredible shape. Plus he played football at school. So part of the year he was dealing with that, right? Because I've been working with him since like February, I think. And then after football, you know, it still has school to deal with. And through finals and everything has a full time job that he's built for himself doing long care and stuff. Guys, he, he saved up his money to buy equipment, gym equipment. And because he lives out in the country, lives on a farm, he literally built his own gym like all these great commercial pieces. Oh, that's awesome. You know, and he's literally a teenager. The guy didn't miss a beat, didn't cheat on the diet once, didn't ask for a cheat meal once. You know, like he, he was incredible. So he wants to take this as far as he can. So he competed. He had to, he couldn't compete in the NPC because he's under 18, right? So he, we found a show in the OCB in out of state in Colorado. So him and his mom hopped down a plane together and they flew to Colorado. And he absolutely killed it, man, checked in every time I needed him to in the morning, you know, leading into the show. Perfect. It was right on track with everything. I mean, both guys were Paul was as well. But you know, it's very impressive when a teenager can, can keep it together like that. And now we're working together on an offseason. He wants to see how much muscle he can grow. Didn't you send a picture of him? Yeah, that's one of 16 years old, right? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So he's, he's doing incredible. So he, he ended up winning the team division and he took fourth place in the novice division out of a slew of guys. And he took, it was a team division with seven guys and he ended up winning that. And then fourth place in novice and fourth place in open. So there was a bunch of dudes there and I mean, he's only going to do so much, you know, with respect, he doesn't have a ton of muscle yet. He's only a kid, right? Yeah, right. So the 17 year old version of my advice, it's not Costco membership in a bottle of test. It's Costco membership and a marketplace account by equipment. Yeah. Right? There you go. Yeah. That's the more expensive version. Yeah, it's a little more expensive action. You need your parents. You need to be living with your mom and dad for that. Yeah. But yeah, yeah. Like, why is it garage fold? Why can't I park my car in here? Like getting ready for a show, mom? Yeah, I love that. They have a little like, because they're on the farm, they had a pole barn that they weren't using for anything. Oh, no way. So it's his pole barn now. Oh, yeah, that's what it was. I thought it was. I thought it was literally the first few times he was sending me, because he sent me some video showing me what he had or, like, that's a weird gym here. I thought it was like the high school facility, you know, like, no, that was his stuff. Yeah, that's cool. Start it down. Yeah, I was like, you know, do you have a seated, you guys have a seated hamstring curl? And he was like, no, I don't, but I could get one. You know, what kind should I get? I'll start saving. I know. That's like, brain, that's like, brain, put up a video of us all training at the compound the other day. That's what I'm talking about. I saw that. That was great. And, and a lot of the comments, like, one guy's like, oh, man, I made some mistakes in life. I kept buying cars. So I've been buying cars and I see what you got. And I'm like, damn, I shouldn't have been buying all those cars, you know what I mean? Yeah. And Braidon's like, I don't even own a car. Braidon drives his work truck. He does it, does he? Yeah. He just drives his work truck everywhere. He's like, I don't need a car. I've got a work truck. Yeah. I'll set you know, and equipment. Yep. That's not equipment though. Braidon has, he could sell memberships to his own business. Well, he's training people out of it now, like home business, right? He's got a personal training business running out of there. Good move. You know, you get to crank your own music and just train one on one with them. And yeah, so that's the way you want to do it. Yeah, yeah. If I was younger, I would have that too, just to avoid humans. Right. Again, back to avoid people, save 20%. Mutants speaking of, I have to bring this up because somebody asked and I have to do it anyways, because it was on my mind. Yeah. But we had a question of a pet peeve in the jail. Oh, yeah. And I have a big one. And it's not that people know. Tell us, Dusty. But those who get on the treadmill and get on phone calls in their AirPods, because they're speaking loud enough to hear their own voice. Yeah. There's that. So they don't realize how loud it is. And you're on the bike or treadmill next to them. Listen to your music and all I can hear is you yelling in my ear. Oh, so I'd really like it if people just, I don't know, just do your fucking cardio. Don't feel the need to be on a full. Are you even doing the cardio hard enough if you just carry on a normal conversation? Not in my eyes. But yeah, that's rough. It was a rough 20 minutes today. I'm going. Dusty doesn't like other people getting things done. Got it. Oh, no. No. Get it done elsewhere. It's the same when they're walking around the gym on a call. I'm like, the walking around the gym on the call thing doesn't really bother me, but I just find it funny when like, you know, I got my headphones in, but you know, maybe a song ends. So there's gap. And I hear some guy like, oh, yeah, yeah, tell him that's fine. You know, and I real, and he's like loading plates on a machine talking to himself. Yeah. Oh, yeah, tell him that's fine. Yeah, that's no problem. We can do that. You can get 10 of those like they're like running their business while they're training. I mean, hey, all the power to you. That's what you want to do. I just find it hilarious because it looks like they're talking to themselves. I just say, you know, if you went back 30 years, we would think everyone was insane. If you walk around talking to themselves, just funny. It just sounds funny to me. I got it. I do the way to get around to me. If I can't, if I need to be on a call, I shouldn't be in the gym. And if I need to be in the gym, I've owned businesses. It survived 90 minutes without me. Yeah. I will. I will get on my treadmill and I get cranking and after I've caught my breath and everything, if I need to send a voice memo, like I want to explain to this guy what I want to do. You know, I'll do it. in my own home, I wouldn't do that in public when you're trying to do cardio next to me. I just don't think if people realize that my point is it's louder, like if you had someone walking on treadmill and you were talking to them, that's fine, obviously. But I don't think, because I do it, Nicky will walk up and I'm gonna sit and I'm like, I got three more to go and she's like, you're fucking yelling. I do that on the plane. Oh. And then I'm like, I was that guy. Cause I can hear you know what I mean? So you're being odd one up so you can hear your own voice and she's like, you literally yelled at the whole gym you have three sets left. I'm like, yeah, I do that on the plane. In Victoria gets very embarrassed. Michael Scott's so funny. One more meme. Just one more. Watch this one. This one's the best season four episode six kills me every time. Yeah. Yeah, she can't take you anywhere. Scott, oh, you guys were talking TV before we started and I stopped you. I was like, stop for the show. There was a TV show. You were watching Dusty. Oh, you're watching started. Yeah. Yeah. That I don't know why you didn't turn me on to that earlier, Ron, since I know you've seen it. I mean, we watched an episode of we're like 20 minutes and I looked around like, this is a mess. I love it. Oh, it's a good show. And it's just getting, we watched three episodes straight last night. Finally, I got a bad name. Like I could have watched four more without it's it's a hard lesson. In how badly the police oh, yeah, bumbled and fumbled and completely screwed up the handling of him. They could have arrested him way before and they ignored the signs, they ignored the neighbors that kept calling them in front of them. Yeah. And that neighbor kept calling and complaining and no one did a single thing and it is a crazy story. And I remember I was in high school when that all like the late 80s, early 90s, right? I was coming into high school. I remember it like happening. I remember them catching every dog. I've never seen it in the news when they're like coming out of his apartment with like bags and you know evidence. Yeah, empty sand. There was a human head and you know, the fact there was the the vat with the chemicals in it and the body disposal and the freezer full of meat and just insane shit. And I remember everyone being like, you know, because at the time that was like the ultimate predator. Yeah, you know, hitting the news and everything like people just couldn't comprehend. I mean, it already had son of Sam and all those killers, but he was cannibalizing them and like it was next level of like horror, real life horror that we were all living on the six o'clock news every night as the evidence of the case came out in the trial. Yeah. Like, you know, and that was back in a different time when we were all in a monoculture, right? Everyone was aware. Yeah. Now a day is like, if you're in your algorithm, you haven't heard the news, you know, watch cable. You don't know that some guy got arrested for that. You know, you should. Yeah. Plus it's happening like every other week now. Yeah. Now back in that was the days of the monoculture, which is a topic I love talking about by the way, if anyone wants to look into that. We grew up in a monoculture and it's so amazing to think about how ever how connected everyone was by everything like that. Like the next day, you could just say, hey, see the news and everyone just be like, oh my God, like everyone knew what was going on. Yeah. Yeah. That's a great. So I think it's, you know, so we started obviously with the last show I told you we were watching. So we're on like a serial killer run. Okay. Also watching on on prime Hannibal. Have you seen that? No. Oh, yeah. We showed we're we're into that one as well. Oh, man. He's a great actor. So you finished the profiler or whatever that was. Oh, yeah. It was called the profiler. My hunter. Yeah. Yeah. That show is so good. And now we're just locked into serial killers. So, you know, just a normal night at the Han Shos, decided between Hannibal and we're on season two of Jack Ryan. And it's I love that show. Like it really good and season season one was great, right? But season two, I feel like they took it up a notch. I'm definitely plugged into that one. Ron, did you guys finish Fargo? We finished season four. Okay. Okay. So season four was a little slower of a slug. That was the little harder season. But the payoff at the end was really good. I liked how it wrapped up. And then when you realize like the little boy grows up and you realize my favorite character. He's my favorite character. Yeah, he's great. Yeah. And you realize who the little boy becomes in the later in the earlier seasons and you're like, oh, now it all kind of ties together. Totally makes sense. Also, like it wasn't my favorite season, but I thought Chris Rock was awesome in it. Oh, he really was. Really, really, really. He's a great actor, man. Like he really nailed that part. He did a fantastic job. Yeah. And it's cool because we all think Chris Rock is a comedian and stuff. But he's got some, he's got the ability to, to lay it down as an actor. So great. So we're going to wrap up season five. We're going to finish the, we get the John Ham season coming up. So we'll see how that goes. It definitely is more energetic, energetic. It picks up and yeah, it's definitely it's going to, it's good. You'll enjoy, I think you'll enjoy it. It's a little more fun too. Okay. Okay, cool. Cool. Okay. So is that it, boys? That's good. We're going to show in the books. A show we've suggested shows that we're doing. Okay. So remember, like, share, subscribe, comment, and. And the bell. That's right. And remember, I'm mutant.com. Go to I'm mutant.com, get your eyes to search, get your all in, get your mind if K and everyone should get on the gear. Lots of gear. Okay. Big Ron and Dusty are your codes. Save 20%, avoid people. Thanks everybody. And remember, it's just bodybuilding.

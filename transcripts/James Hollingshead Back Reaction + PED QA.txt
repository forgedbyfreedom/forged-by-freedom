 and I'm already using insulin pre workout. I'm gonna take a closer look at my intranet. You're repairing your mitochondria and you're bringing them up to optimal levels. Your cells are healthier. You're gonna get more life cycles. All right, let's try again. All right, let's get nasty, James. That's a big dumbbell. Yeah, it is, man. And it's maturing. It makes it even heavier. Yeah. And the cuff part had to overheat too, you know? Well, what I noticed in that positioning is that his back is not coming up more than like, like an inch or two. And that's my biggest critique with people on his exercises. They start here, then they're up here by the end of the set or by the end of the rep. Yeah. Well, he's on his elbow. He's only going to bow into it. Yeah. He's around his hand. He can get up. That was a great point. That was a brutal set. Yeah. What's up, guys? Welcome back to Blood Sweat and Gear with Coaches.

I haven't watched this ahead of time. I don't think you guys watched this ahead of time either. James Hollings had like nasty trainer, like old school kind of hardcore dude. But he's also got some new school stuff too. Like he doesn't go quite as, quite as dark as he used to. He has a video called How I Built a Top tier Back. And I was like, man, I want to see this. But not only do I want to see this, I want to watch this with skip and Andrew so we can talk about it at the same time. So I've got that one all cute up here. We've got James. I don't even know what's going to happen here. If there's going to be any kind of preamble, looks like he's not in the gym out the gate. We'll find out. I get to be a gym. It's called Hand 1. Eight, eight, eight, one, uh-oh. And you're really not sugar bar bills company. I'm not going to get out as far as I'm going. Uh, easy. Anyway, this does not look like a gym. We've got some work to do. We've got a lot of work to do. It's like an art studio. Yeah, yeah. That is what we're doing today. We'll be training back. And I've got a high day because my body weight is really low today. So it's going to be fun. See you in a bit. All right, guys. Welcome. Hopefully you checked out the last video, which was the locker room talks here in the gym. It's back day in house gym. My favorite gym in Norway. One of my favorite in the world. Hopefully you've been checking out the previous videos. That gym is not on the first floor. In my room. The most down to earth. But you get some good natural lighting pictures available. That's what I'm seeing too. So you haven't checked them out. Go and have a look on there. Now, we're going to mix up today. We're going to take a little bit different. We're going to show you some exercises and alternatives that you haven't seen yet on the channel. Because there is so many different bits of key here. So we're actually going to. We're actually going to use an assisted pull up machine today, which is something you've never seen for a long time. You guys do assisted pull ups over. Great old piece. Rarely. They kind of really hurt my shoulders now. And I'm doing a lot of shoulder stuff to increase mobility, increase capsular space. But I do love them as an exercise. I know skip like some. Yeah, I do. I'm a big fan. Do you do them every week or? No. And I typically only use them with a neutral grip. I feel better on your shoulders. It honestly feels better on my advice. OK, will that do? Yeah, it's just an ad. And because I'm so narrow or shouldered anyway, it's not a great feel with the traditional grip. You know, I used to have Andrew. As we do this, you may have heard of this term. I think he called it like the gauntlet of death or something. It was a John Meadows thing where you would do assisted pull up two wide, two medium grip and two narrow grip. And you would get a full stretch at the bottom. And when you pulled up to the top, you'd pull all the way up to the point where you're looking over the machine, seeing all the dust that never gets wiped off the top and then slow negative down like a gymnast would. You know, like that gymnast level of control. Oh my god, dude, every time we did those, my back would literally spasm on the right home. My lats would. We used to do banded with John. Oh, yeah. Sorry, you'd start out with regulars and then immediately throw a band in there. So you get a few more reps and then take the band off and then he pulled on you as you held it in the midpoint for like 20 seconds and you're like, yeah. My mind is going to drop you wide on a pool to get more quality of contraction in the back. Whereas if I really wide, it changes the emphasis onto the mid back. So I'm trying to get a little bit more lat. So kind of like a shoulder width grip just a bit wider. Sounds like skips, J.M. And thank you for spying quite upwards, I've got an arc and my hands are like keep rolling forward. Like I heard about my handles, Robin and rolled back. Just a quick note to about the assisted chin. I much prefer the old school sidebacks that you put your feet on. Same versus. Oh, yeah. I agree. I know what you're talking about. Yeah. Just take it. But really think about what you're talking about. Skip, can you lean into your mic a little bit more? Something because I feel like you're a little bit quiet compared to the other volumes. How about now? It's good. OK, cool. Now is it true if you pull with a really wide grip, it's going to work with width. And if you pull with a more narrow stance, you're going to get more thickness. That's an Arnold side, right? I think so, yeah. You like to pull a bit more progression. Like a narrow grip pull down or a pull over. Something else that's also essentially going to work the last. Right, that's what. We just got to close up with that beard. Yeah, that's a man beard. Yes. I've got 30 kilograms on their system. So if I weigh 120-ish, I should only be putting 90 kilos. You're not a weak one, though. I'll say this, though. I do appreciate assisted and banded over regular pull ups. Yeah. Yeah, I just, I feel it my last way better. I feel it my back overall way better. You could control it more. You know, you could control it. And I know I'm using my shoulders if I'm using. If I'm doing it freestyle. Yeah. So yeah, let's try and see what we can do. Doesn't feel like anything on here. One, two, three. Let's count. Three. I know that feeling you keep reducing the amount of help resistance. And you get to that point where that work and set comes. And you're like, God, do I even have anything on here anymore? You know what I mean? Yeah. I think it's good because it just keeps you, your body straight up and down. You're not doing a lot of this leaning back stuff to make the movement lower the row. 100%. 100%. What my strongest position, I'll tell you. I like the look of this gym, by the way. It's a good, this particular movement, I feel like you get that initial tug under the armpit, which you think I really like. That microphone is not working very well. It just feels like it goes through the right places. Sometimes, you know what I mean? Sometimes he's talking down into it or when he's breathing, when he's training. I think he is like, you know, because he's training, he's moving around. Yeah. We got a little different angle here now. What's the number one? You're happy for getting anywhere close to that now. What is that? Jingle all the way that poster on the right. The old school. Yeah, it sure is. You talking about that calf machine? No, the poster. Short to nigger movie poster. Oh, I think they're about that calf machine in the back. Those are hard to find. Are they? Yeah. Back off sets pretty good on Surnick's side as well. So I'd ask you to slide the opposite reps with a little bit less load. So you can still grab a doctor set. But on the other hand, because in a movement, the way I feel is I'm just going to repeat the set and hopefully get a few less reps and just push towards the feet. Probably hard to find just because if you have an angle leg pressure, basically getting the same move, the same movement, the same angle on the calf anyway. But they're pretty uncommon from at least from the gyms I've been in. Bought as uncommon as a regular peck deck. Yeah. Good luck finding a regular peck deck these days anymore. Yeah. Good stretch there on the east that he's getting. I like that big stretch. You know, Skipper, we're talking previously about favorite comedians on the pre-roll before the episode last time. Yeah. Underrated, I think Arnold's actually a good comedian because his acting is so bad. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That is overacting. Like a serious movie and you just start burst out laughing when he says something. Yeah. I'm working. OK, I love this, Jim. All right, put my tripod. Last one, mother, there's one key. This place is cool. What's it called? Haral, something, Jim? Second, we're going to use this handle. It's a little bit different. You do like a underhand or an underhand. Haralds? Haralds, Jim. Oh, there are Norway, so they spell Harald with an A. Yeah. We're swat arching it back. So. OK, we're going to pull down. We're not using this one. I like to kind of lean about here. And then pull to the upper back. OK. So it's a little bit different. Make sure everybody's travel a little bit forward. Is the art is arc and arch the same as far as British? I don't know. Because they're not the same for I'm not. That meaning to be pedantic here, but they're not the same here. So I didn't know if they were there. How often do you guys do like a pull up and a pull down in the same session? Not often. That's the first thing I was thinking. Yeah, how about you? Rarely. It's usually one type of pull down movement. And then, yeah, usually a row with a neutral grip, a row with a pronated grip, and then a pull over or something else that I'm working on typically. Yeah. If I'm going to be redundant, it'll be on. Or you're going too fast. Now, sometimes people really do try and hold back. It'll be on rowing. If I'm going to repeat. And a lot of time, then they get to this weight that's heavier than that warm up, and then they can't even do eight. Repeat an exercise. Repeat an exercise. I'll be like eight on a warm up. Then that is an warm up. So just be really honest, because that's something you don't see happen a lot. I see a lot of people trying to go way heavier because selling soda or something such thing. You notice this machine, you have to have a certain level of quad size into the machine and it actually gives you some resistance on the thighs. You're not even using it now. Yeah, which is power to him. I mean, but I don't think there's any adjustableness of that thigh. It's not even a thigh pad. It's a metal tube. Yeah. You see someone do five plate bend rests. Don't do this machine the day after like day. Yeah. That thing will dig right into the quads. No rush. It'll be back for it in the long run. I can't say the work. Think that he lower that down. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Watch it jumps. He changes it and then the video cuts might keep your eye in that pad. Well, that bar. Here we go. Watch it. That's some old school equipment right there. And it's down slower. You're right. You're right. Oh, he's going heavy now because I was watching him before and I was like, okay, so James isn't really moving that much weight. It was just a warm up. Now he looks like he's about to stack it. Now he's going to do one or the other, which one are you going to do the lap puller or the chin? It depends on how I'm feeling. If I'm feeling energetic, I'm doing the pull ups. If I'm normal, I'm doing the pull down. Because as far as the feel is concerned for me between the two exercises, I'll take the assisted channel, Dela. But you're going to be able to do that. But you still have to do that. If I had to use that grip that he's using right now, I would never do pull downs again for the rest of my life. I can't stand. It's too wide for me and I can't get a new children's feel out of it. Oh, really? So that's my money right there. Is it? Well, you're a tall guy too. Yeah, I'm tall. I'm tall. He's got a wide frame too. So I can see how you guys can make use of this. He looks good on it. It looks like it's working for him. Dude, the other thing I'm noticing, look how close his knees were to that freaking stat coming down. A second ago, it was like a centimeter away. And I'm like, like it's creepy, dude. He's working this set too. Like this is a little bit of body English air. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I don't think to the point of unacceptable, though, D. No, I just being our chair quarterback. I just say for anybody watching, they may be like, well, that's a lot of momentum. I mean, I'm sure the 135 pound broccoli head kids are going to have something to say about it. Why he's not achieving the lat development that they have. Right. Yeah, yeah, right. Yeah, I have nothing to critique on anything James does. If it's, you know what I'm saying? It's like if it's working for him. Oh, well, I'm just making commenter. I wouldn't presume to critique an athlete of James's caliber on pretty much anything. Yeah, no, I know what you're saying. The guy still squats seven plates for 10 reps or something like that. Like, you know what I mean? And I tell you, there's certainly a pattern where extremely well developed physics rarely will have flawless mechanics. I think people like Nick and you know, like even Roman Fritz and guys that they're kind of the exception to the rule. That's true. Just in Shire, another exception. It's almost the point where it looks like there's no intensity with some of these guys. And this isn't a critique, but with like Nick or just just in particular, it almost looks like there's no intensity in the training because the reps are so textbook flawless. Yeah, yeah. And obviously it works for them, not knocking what they do in any stretch of the word. But whereas like you see James here, like he's gotten like you see like he's. It's more dramatic looking. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's when you know you can go the whole fucking way. But then when you lift and you see like the weight that they're using like Justin on that chest supported T bar and he's got like six and a half plates on it. It's like, oh God, just moving that at all, you know? Yeah. And then you know, absolutely being and that nothing can ever get in the way that I feel in. And that this is as normal to you as breathing oxygen. All right, we'll see this set and then I'll jump forward a little bit into the next area. Next. Next. This is probably normal breathing fucking oxygen. May the only one that jumped? It's got to be like the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, unconditioned love you have for a parent. We mess some stuff here guys. You have to have the same love for this. You don't be married to this. You got to turn up every single fucking day and love it just as much the first day if not more as you like. It's very along the line because it's hard. But when you love it, it's a matter of hard. You know, everything you say makes sense. Like to people who are, you know, passionate about training and everything else. But do you know how bizarre that would sound to the average person? It would just literally make people roll their eyes and be like, yeah, okay, buddy. I see it. You mean about those knees there? Dude, I'm getting worried. It's very close. Maybe it's the angle. It ain't that much of an angle. I see what you mean, Skip, that like to me, that was a completely normal statement. Like I totally understand that. But to somebody maybe who's like, not into what we do, they'd be like, dude, it's just weights. It's just been lifted. Get on with your life. Yeah. Well, but I also think it should be pointed out to maybe people that aren't in a place in life financially or, you know, career wise. You can't necessarily have the body building his life attitude because, well, you got to support yourself. You can't pay your bills and you should be moving forward because at some point your physique isn't going to look the way it did in your 20s and 30s. You know, I think I totally commit or relate to what James is saying with an asterisk of like, but also as long as it's not to turn you from moving forward in life in general. Yeah. I read it as this personally. I read it as that when he says like, show up. It's like, you've got to bring that intensity every time you get in the gym, you know, like there are no days that you just kind of like just halfway do it. Like every time you train, you got to be on. I got you. Don't say one side show up because you're in a rush. Oh, dude, I see that all the time. He just said, don't sell one side shore because you're in a rush. Do you guys ever anybody who sends you video and they do one side of a row and immediately jump straight into the other side without having taken a break? And I'm like, number one, that wasn't really hard enough if, you know, you didn't take a break. Yeah. I don't know what number two is. Well, number two is if it was hard enough, you're short-changing the other side. Yeah. Yeah. Just from an oxygen utilization standpoint, you're going to gas out before you're even hit muscular fatigue. This gym has a third floor. Oh, we'll tell you though, back in the day. One after another. Yeah. You didn't. Yeah. Yeah. Like it wasn't even, no, you never waited. Really? No, never. Is it because you had a body training with you and you were just like, yeah, I don't know. I think it was just so because I was trying to think of the reason it was just accepted that had you waited, it probably would have been like, what are you doing? Like get after it. Seriously, like that. You trained one side of your body today? That kind of thing. Yeah. Yeah. I have a feeling James is going to go hard on this. Requires a lot of energy. So remember Evan was saying these kind of movements when you're in a prep calurific. That's what it is. It's a great calurific calurific. All right, let's try again. All right, let's get nasty James. That's a big dumbbell. Yeah, it is. And it's matching the feels. It makes it even heavier. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's my biggest critique with people on his exercises. They start here, then they're up here by the end of the set or by the end of the rep. All of his own is elbow, you don't know him, too. I'm on his hand. You can get up. That's a great point. That was a brutal set. Beautiful As he said, beautiful. Yeah, that was good. I was one more set. Left thumb? Yeah. I love two. I love to skis. We're in a position in the world now in today's society where you can, he can have that this full on conversation with us in this gym, talking to himself and nobody cares. Like they totally get what he's doing. Flashback 20 years ago to be like, this guy's crazy. You know, talking to himself while he's working out shooting videos. I don't know, because I feel like the guys back the day that we're on his caliber bodybuilding wise is if you wear in the Zubaz pants and, you know, the t-shirts with like the strings cut into him. So you're like, oh, that's a bodybuilder. Stay out of his way, man. He's going to be crazy shit today. Yeah. He's, he's talking to himself. Yeah. Come on, James. Let's see this one. I'm getting pumped up now. I want to see this set. Yeah, my back. I'm getting ready to row. Yeah, me too. I'm going to do rosin next time I train back. That mom. Oh, yeah, that angle, dude. Nice. Come on. Good stretch. Still getting his elbow up too. Yeah. Nice. Those are all full reps. Good point, man. It's a full of reps. Come on. Yes. Hell yeah. Blue the whole set. Good. Nice. Yeah. Yeah. Nice. Those are all full reps. Good point, man. It's a full of reps. Come on. Yes. Hell yeah. Blue the whole set. Yeah. Blue the whole set. Good set. Resisting negative on the way down. This is kind of even left. But so far, you know what, these three exercises, bread and butter, they're basics. Yeah. Oh, yeah. There's nothing novel here. Well, and I also want to point out he's in a contest prep. Right. As he's saying, like the calorific exercises, he's probably not having to do a shit on a cardio because he's not doing, you know, machines that are comfortable, that are keeping him in, you know, a seated position. He's doing the hardest stuff possible. We're here, relax, sure. No, and to man. So you can win the show as soon as you turn around. You only do that by lifting some serious. It's my team. Yeah. Lift the team for the win. That was a decently short break if he's going right into it considering what he just did. Yeah. Let's try again. Ah. Oh. How many reps and reserved was that? Am I the only one checking out all the people in the background too? Of course. I'm not going to. We're obviously really willing to say that so you can just get straight in there. Just pull. Just pull as hard as you can. I think that calf machine is older than I am. It's got the chrome plates on it. So let's just make sure that we use as much force. Because we can. It's a really nice stretch on everything he's doing with his back doesn't he? Yeah. What's his machine called? I don't even know man. Yeah. Skip. No. Not from that. I think it's a penata. See how it gets. Is it just me or to get a little wider as he pulls out as he pulls back? Yeah, it is. I think it is a little. Yeah. Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Let's see if he gets into next here. It's into some cable. See the cable. Yeah, this gym is amazing. I love any gym that has the old pictures up around the top like that. It has some level of some type of wood paneling in there. Yeah. You know, there's been a lot of good physiques through there over the years. Yeah. I always say like I like my gym's clean but not like like that clean. You know, like a lot of the new gym today. Yeah. Like I like it. It's got some some life to it. You know, it's got some history. You can just kind of smell it in the air. And you notice like it's got the penata stuff, but it's not the brand new penata stuff. I always like the older versions of good equipment versus the new stuff they make. Still do it on the other hand. It would be beneficial for back. People always think. But it's definitely fine. I feel pretty good to be free. I'm going to do that again. When it comes time. Rest up a little bit first. Be nice if they made a pully row long pully row within a just seat bench to. With what? Justible seat bench. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And you can adjust the pulley obviously too. The seat bench will probably be easier. Let me ask you guys. What do you think about like when you're doing the rows? And you notice how he was like leaning forward like Arnold style at the stretch. Yeah. And then kind of using his back to pull and then got a full a full row at the end. How do you feel about coming forward like that? I can't do it. Yeah. I don't like it. I don't have a lot of money left. Yeah. I think it depends on the situation. If I had somebody who really need to grow there like they needed a lot of lats. I would want them to be more locked into it. Because I'm afraid that they're going to start using more momentum. Yeah. Whereas if it's a guy like with his experience, then I'm going to be like, well, you know what you're doing. You know, even if you even if he is using like some level of momentum, maybe that's allowing him to get a better negative. Like I have your negative, you know. Sure. But for somebody that doesn't have a back, I'd be like, yeah, let's not do that. I think it would be said though that technically the directors should be used for bracing only, not for movement during that exercise. Highest extensions as well. Yeah. So he's not going to sell at all in this workout during contest prep, you know. I'm sorry. I should have said for audio people at home. I should have been telling them exactly everything we're doing. He's getting into dead snouts for exercises in. There's going to be terrible 20 minutes for audio. And how many working sets so far as he does? Two lap hole arguably two assisted chins. Very very. I think what he's doing is two top sets trying to match reps on the second one as close as he can to what he got on the first one. Yeah. So two four six then the penata machine for eight. And then this will be a second set of days for ten. Viking. You're like seriously. He's got to have some Viking blood in him. Yeah, this is where I tap out. At the end, you know, all that other stuff first. If I were to do deadlifts, I would absolutely put them at the end. This is what we used to always do training with Shelby. Yeah, I'm not walking around with Lord. I'm pumped up trying to do other other back exercises. And it limits your overall strength. You're going to use on that exercise. So it's going to be a little safer theoretically. Yeah. I don't know how I'd be able to do those don't want to arm dumbbells after doing this. Yeah, exactly. Come on. Yeah, totally Viking. Yeah, if we did a DNA test, I'm sitting here as Viking. But if you're wondering, more stuff, some use in the session. We have the industry. Rist and crap with the rubber adhesive. So I'm not losing company. In the heritable. The back and closing the back. Don't think about hip-hoping in too much. Still do some hypers on top of that. Wow. I'm getting enough low back. This is an old school backworked out. Yeah, it really is. It really is. I mean, I remember doing work, probably the exact same workout to a tee. 20 times over in my 20s. You know, pull down, pull ups, pull downs, rows, dead lifts, a couple other machines. And then finishing up with hypers. Yeah. And none of this, I wouldn't call any of this easy. And none of this was like, here's the easiest. Here's the pump stuff, you know what I mean? I just sent you guys a picture of the new straps that I have. And I've training for 41 years. This is the first time I've used them and I love them. I have always used the old school cotton. I tried other things. I hate them. I go back to my cheap old school cotton ones. But I got a pair of these and I freaking love them. It's obviously it's a pair. I'm coming through. I'm not going to be able to do anything on time. I don't see it either. Oh, really? Oh, maybe it probably went to Instagram. Sorry. Oh, okay. Oh, yeah, I did. Yeah. Okay. Just because I know this works. Sorry. The grip, they're comfortable. They're super easy to get into. Just I really like it. Almost do muscle rounds. But no, muscle rounds are going on the brakes. See, it's like four sets. Wait, see muscle rounds. I'm not discussing. I feel like I'm muscle round. Because the fatigue is pretty real in this. And I've been doing muscle rounds for my legs. I don't really do two sets. Yeah. Yeah, because you only go to failure once, but you get a lot of volume in. And it's helping me to limit the central nervous system fatigue I get while still getting in a good amount of volume. And then my legs are feeling pretty, pretty toasty, you know, the next day. Nice. Without trash in my central nervous system. Oh, you sent that to Will Chung too. Oh, did you? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I see them. They're like, Versa grips. Yeah. Yeah. Lead FTS version though. Yeah. Alright. How much of those on the website? Free. Oh, yeah. Everybody else. Yeah. I don't even know. I'm not sure. Versa grips are expensive though. Like 80 or 90 bucks. Yeah. So they weren't anywhere near that. I want to say they were 30 or 40 bucks, 35 bucks, something like that. That ain't bad. No, not at all. No. Might have to try them. And you know, they'll outlive men. Is anything with lead FTS on it? I think it's just. I can't damage it. I use these sheepskin ones that I have had for years. I love leather straps. Yeah. See, I don't because they feel slimy. That's why I like the cotton. I can't even really nylon because it's it feels slick to me. I like the old school cotton. And the only reason I like these is because it almost feels like it's. Has tacky on it. Huh. Like it. This is sticky. It's a different exercise. Yeah. It's going to say this isn't strike me as like a traditional rear delt. This is like kind of. It kind of goes against the grain of trying to keep your knuckles as far away from your midline as possible like bringing your knuckles to the wall. Okay. It's not going to say it doesn't work. It's obviously. Yeah. It's like an upright row. Yeah. It's kind of his version of a dumbbell upright row. Yeah. With a pronated grip though, it's making you target those adults a little bit more. I don't really count his work because he's not. Yeah. For anybody who still is listening to this on audio guys, go to Spotify or or to YouTube. So you can see the video. Watch this with us. Just tickle the rear. Just tickle the rear. Don't. Again, I'm using 16 key. So. Very. Every time every time that I think it's done, it's. Nope. That's not it. It's got to do calves at the end. All right, James. You're a freaking monster. And I think we can all agree on that. We'll stop it at that. Wouldn't it be nice if your job was to continue becoming the best bodybuilder? Like you're livelihood, your sponsors are paying you to do this. So those calves isn't afterthought. They're not an afterthought. They're what you do. You're stretching everything. Yeah. It's pretty cool. Yeah, I agree. It's pretty cool. I'm a huge fan of him too. Like just his personality and everything about James. So I'm excited to see what you can do over this, you know, in this next show. I don't think the issue with James is ever his preparation or his musculature. I think for him it's those last three to four days where the pictures we see where he's bone, dry, call it Caucasian field, like skin is so thin. And then what you see on stage is you're like, where'd they go wrong? Because he tends to have a like a watery, not as dry look as some of the other competitors. And sometimes it's skin tone and the way the tan hits some of the white guys, you know. Yeah. I would just, I'm like, I'm with you Scott. I've always been a fan of his. I wanted to see him nail his peak and, you know, I think he did a good job. I got to see him in person at the Detroit Pro. That really best. Yeah. Second row man, six feet away from him hitting his most muscular in the post down, you know. And yeah, it was so good. And I talked to him and his wife afterward. And what it's been to is that they they've had to load him was so much food. And it was her. She had said that she had said like, hey, with how much food he's eating, I step on one of them to keep it clean. She's like, no, he needs to eat a burger. And they let him go out and eat a burger and fries or whatever. And like that worked better. And so they realized like they got it. They've been trying to keep it super clean with tons and tons of super clean food going in. But they found like they think there's something to it adding something that's going to be a little dirtier to really get that pop they need. Makes sense. He did look a lot better Detroit than he did was at the Arnold, I believe. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. It was interesting because talking to him at the Arnold, he was still pumped. Like he was number one, just like honored to be there again. But then number two, he was like, we're on to something, you know, like he had that attitude, which was cool. Nice. Yeah. It's awesome. Hey, do you notice this, Andrew? Jumping straight into listening questions and you guys are welcome to comment with more questions. Rascal says does a SLU raise heart rate? I noticed it raised my heart rate and initially it raised my blood pressure too. Yep. I'm not going to say it's a side effect that 100% of people will experience probably 50-50. Yeah. And to the case where some people it's like we have to back off the dose because, you know, it's bedtime and their heart rate's 110-105. Yeah. So yeah, no, it is a potential side effect for some people. So, you know, we talk about compounds being pretty innocuous in terms of side effects. This is one we probably should mention that I always do forget to bring up. Because I see it as much as a body building supplement as an anti-aging kind of health supplement. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Because I really do think you're repairing your mitochondria and you're bringing them up to optimal levels. Your cells are healthier. You're going to get more life cycles. You're going to get a longer healthier life out of it. So when I talk about these things, I think of them more as a background health supplement slash. It's like taking your car into the shop to get the oil changed, the fluid stopped off before you get on a long journey. I love that analogy, man. I think that I can't think about better one. You said that I'm the show a while back and I've stolen that and I've used that now when explaining it to other people because I think it's still just bang on. I have so many analogies in my training partner. She would always be like, oh my hold on, let me write this one down. She's going to start an Instagram page with all my analogies. I'll be sitting there and I'll be like, well you know a prep is like a journey. When you're going off to see and you got to make sure that you got the right amount of food and you got the right amount of clean water and you got the right amount of vitamin C. So you don't get scurvy. I'll come up with all these funny analogies. I end up with a bunch of them too. Well it's like driving a car or it's like building a fire or it's like cutting a lawn. You know how I'm going to get all these? What about the Daniel Askas? How many weeks into EQ cycle should one check for thickening of the blood? First off this is an exclusive to EQ. All PETs. I don't know of an antibiotic androgenic compound that doesn't have an effect on blood viscosity and whatnot. Can you guys think of any? I mean I'm just saying that as an aside but I mean I don't know. I've never started a cycle and had a full panel done four weeks into it. It's more like okay let's see after 10 weeks or 20 weeks of the cycle or after the cycle or usually before a cycle to make sure it's okay to do the cycle. So I can't give a direct answer. I don't know if you guys ever done labs like three or four weeks into a cycle and been like oh my blood's already up. No. And even if it was elevated my next question would be well how much more is it going to elevate? So three or four weeks in just doesn't it's not yeah. Or would your question be like well what are you going to do about it if it is? Yeah. In a sense of are you going to stop your cycle? I mean I would check usually well usually we want to know before the cycle right? Yeah. Are you already borderline like so because you know there's the argument nowadays that used to be 15 years ago that we would like everybody was like we got to keep your hematocrit in range you know. And now everybody is kind of taking the opposite approach where it's like nah it doesn't matter. A medicar it did you hear it doesn't matter at all. You know what I mean that's kind of the vibe I get. But it's like well okay so then is okay so 50s that's that's all right right? How about 55 okay? How about 60? How about 65? Like how what when does it not become okay anymore? Like what stage of kidney failure is acceptable? Right. Right. I mean I think the what you got to look at is you do in a cycle understanding that you're doing some type of damage to your blood work in your organs right? And then the reason the only reason why we ever go off PEDs is to have that time to recycle replenish and and re heal those markers right? Otherwise if these things didn't happen or they were not a big deal we would just stay on massive cycles at nauseam for the for all time you know. So I think it's the if you have the thought process of I'm going to do the cycle. I'm going to see where I'm at afterwards and figure out how much damage quote unquote I've done and then have an appropriate amount of time to deal with that damage not just to clean it up but to have a period of time where you're in a good health phase you know because in Dante always used to say this okay you got your labs on eight weeks after your cycle and everything's normal. But did it just get normal you know seven weeks and six days into it or have you had a period of time of you know a month or two where things are good and normal. So I think we always got to keep that in the background in terms of our our thought processes. I have clients sometimes do blood work at 15 16 weeks out and because they'll say well how long do I do the cycle? Yeah how long are you comfortable doing the cycle because these are the risks and these are the pros and cons but if your markers come back and they look pretty good at 15 16 weeks push another four to five weeks at that point. It's not likely that all of a sudden in four to five weeks after being on for 15 or 16 weeks that you're going to then all of a sudden have a grigis you know number. So I'm not going to fault the cliff in four weeks. And that's what I'll so I'll check before and if everything was in a position where we're like hey we're probably pretty we're good here you know these at these levels. I might check again at that 12 to 16 week range if we're going to say to ourselves let's try to push it that would be the thing of like okay we're at say 14 weeks in and we're thinking everything's telling us like your strength is getting better. You've got a lot of room left to grow you know like you're not holding a ton of body fat yet everything's telling us like let's keep doing this but let's get your lab work done and see where your hematocrit is you know that's kind of where I've usually taken it and then we can make a decision based off of that and sometimes we could still stay on but you know look into supplementation or maybe that is where blood letting comes in I must feel like nobody wants to blood let me more because I'm at a critical point where it's at yeah 65 the other thing I'm seeing a lot of is clients sometimes that maybe they're not as experienced in terms of you know competitive cycling all that stuff. They they run the health stuff that we ask them to run when they're on the cycle and then the next check in comes in and like all the stuff we had them taken was missing is missing. And I'm like hey I noticed you stopped taking such as Bergamont you stopped taking you know x y and z and I'm like why I'm off to cycle now I don't need it right it's like oh no no no like like and this is one of those layered costs of body building in my opinion you should be on those things especially when you're off cycle when you're going to get the most benefit of it because let's just say those things are keeping you at a certain level. This is not apples for apples analogy or whatever but let's say they're keeping at a certain level right you want to improve and you want to improve at a fast rate in terms of your health so wouldn't be incumbent to keep those things in because of the health benefit like some people take these health benefits without ever taking P.E.D.s for their health benefits. Yeah I'm saying you know what I mean. Hey what's off guys I have a lot of people who reach out to me on a regular basis who are trying to more effectively reach their goals. One of the biggest mistakes I see people make is that they're not getting enough protein and there's only so much chicken breast we can eat through the day but we can easily add a high quality protein supplement to boost those numbers up. True nutrition has just about every protein powder you can think of from high quality weight isolate if you don't tolerate lactose then you can use their beef isolate or you can use their pea protein isolate if you don't eat animal products. They literally have everything you think of I believe in them for like a decade before they advertised with us and they never went out of their way to say like hey we want to promote our stuff through you I literally asked them because it's a company that I believe in and at the end of the day I want to see you guys reach your goals as effectively as possible. So if you use our code think it true nutrition you'll get some savings you'll help to support our programming and you'll get some high quality products to more effectively reach your goals faster. Hey Skip question for the nutshell after a cut how long should you take before you bump up the calories so you don't get fat and how how to speed back up your metabolism cheers guys love the show. So individual and at the same time we've tried to put numbers on this before try to give people an idea you know coming off of a really aggressive cut you're probably good to go you know 20% on your calories at first 20 25% and just evaluate you know from there and you know cool thing I had a. Have a client who came off a show got into great condition and we start to reverse out. And his calories are literally over twice what they were in the cut and the skip load is all day on Saturday with a meal Friday night before bed and he is out continuing he's only added three pounds to his stage weight the metabolism has responded so well to the adjustments that we've made this is only over the course of just you know eight weeks or so it's in there somewhere eight 10 weeks. The calories have come up considerably but because the incremental changes are relatively small outside of the first one being you know I and it's off the top my head that it was probably 25% yeah it's just been 200 300 calories a week after that now it may not be. I've been exactly that but it's in the ballpark of that just changing every week and then adding another skip load meal and then adding another skip and seeing what I call a baseline. For the first four or five weeks and I'm like man I got to throw more calories that you because you're literally returning to your baseline weight every week as we add all these calories and of course he's getting. Significantly stronger because recovery is you know much better than it was before the calories are higher the gears very very low I believe it's TRT but I have to check on that which just reinforces that a lot of times when you come out of a cut phase whether it's a show or or a pretty dramatic cut phase where you got real lean and that means you're real insulin sensitive and you're going to grow without that gear you just don't need a ton of gear coming into an increased calorie you know basically going into a surplus and building those calories now i'm not going to sit here and pretend that food is as anabolic is gear but I do think a lot of people don't accept that. Accept how anabolic the increase in calories really can be it's almost as if you can count on the food before the gear in the off season especially coming out of a cut phase where going into a cut phase you start to as the calories get lower and you get into a deficit you're almost kind of relying more on the gear and less on the calories so it becomes this you know this switch. 100% I agree with that. Andrew you good with jumping in the next question? Well I think I'll say real quick is that um and it sounds like that's a reverse done 100% right skip in my opinion is um why not getting shape early enough that you can really kick start or start that process four or five weeks out you know I mean I I can use the wife as an example right now she's eating more food than she was in her off season at the peak and she's in her contest. In her contest condition it's just kind of continued and yes there's some help with redder in there but it's been kind of cool to see just how lean someone can stay while essentially almost doubling their calories. Yep right on all right what about what supplements Andrew would you look to add pre intro in post and you guys notice the difference between creatin forms like monohydrate versus HCl. So he's looking for supplements that you would take pre intro and post workout over the counter stuff I'm guessing is what he means. So no halo okay. Yeah pre workout you know honestly all the supplements out there are the same in terms of pre workout pumps they're they're there to increase phase of dilation to increase your pump so you know arginine alpha ketogluorate citralline I'm probably going to forget a bunch but those are your main ingredients and a lot of these pump products right and then intro workout it depends on which goals are but I'm going to do that. I think the things which goals are but I'm a big fan of inch workout carbohydrates a high molecular weight carbohydrate like highly branch cyclic dextrin with essential amino acids and then I like to include creatin or creatin dependent on who we're talking to we're talking about in that product in terms of creatin creatin is the by far the most studied sports supplement in all of human history I think I looked it up they've spent something like $400 million on experiments with this between creatin for creating a lot of things. Creatin monophosphate creatin ethylester creatin alpha ketogluorate creatin malate all the different creatin hydrochloride and what they came back to after spending all that money trying to find a better more efficient creatin creatin creatin monohydrate the same old fashioned career from Germany is the best source so yeah I think what you find with the other creatin sources sometimes is some gastric issues you know like I'm going to create malate and creatin ethylester was causing some GI issues for a lot of people. Creatin monohydrate and I'll say this too before I move on. Creatin monohydrate I'm a big fan of larger doses of it. There are periods of my life. Yeah there are periods where I was like I create you doesn't really do much compared to testosterone or compared to some of the other pounds. Well yeah which it doesn't but okay yeah obviously it does. Yeah if you had to take one or the other. I wonder if trend E or creatin monohydrate. No but you know I think upwards of 20 grams a day for a guy over 200 pounds is totally fine you know not necessarily on one dose but like I myself I take 10 grams in the morning and I take 10 grams in to work out. I've been blasted in 10 to 20 somewhere in there for the mental the brain stuff all the all the stuff with like dementia and all that I'm like man I don't need that stuff and I probably be the first guy to get it so why don't I take some creatin if that's going to help at all. Skip do you have any any supplements that you would like to say like this in because I think Andrew covered like a lot of the bases and I know you're not a creatin fan but is there anything that you're like man I do like this one around training. I don't know if I notice anything specific with any of them but on paper because they're relatively inexpensive I have put a creatin is a good example but I'm not a huge fan of it never really have been and I thought you know what. This is really inexpensive and I'm already using insulin pre workout I'm going to take a closer look at my entry and I put in like a hydro max and I put in a put in the creatin as well and. I can't say that anything is like wow but on paper it all fits together well the EA's the carbs I tolerate I have a hard time tolerating inter carbs well so my body has been very picky about the inter carbs I can use so I have stuck with carbon. Just because it just seems you know I go back to like the days of waxing maize and I still say I will continue to say Dante hates it what I say this but I believe this I'm not you know battle in him or anybody else on it I could be wrong but I say that when you leave waxy maize like you shake it up and you leave it for three minutes it starts to separate I think it does that and you're stomach. It has to to some degree to the point where it's completely separate no probably not but the number down if it separates well if it my point is just that it it will end up that it will be a I almost see it in my brain is a thicker sludge in my stomach yeah probably what happens and causing GI issue I'll tell you what happens because it's not an isotonic solution anymore and if the water is separating from the actual carbohydrate source net and your joy. It's forming the water in your lower GI as it's passing through now it's telling the rest of your body it's saying hey we're in a sympathetic situation where we're trying to train but we're also engaging parasympathetic where we're engaging blood flow and water to the gut to help dilute the solution so then we can keep passing it through and absorb it in the small intestine so I think your right skip about the wax you maize 100% it'd be the same thing is trying to drink I don't know like a way further example is you know you can take ground oats and mix them into water. Yeah if you drink it immediately it's in solution if you let it sit there for two minutes right the oats are all in the bottom the waters the pop it's the same thing now we wouldn't drink be drinking oats during a workout but you know what I'm saying it's we wouldn't be trying to drink ocean workout but it's sending mixed signals to your body via the brain saying are we in parasympathetic rest and digest or we in sympathetic fight or flight training so I can see why some of these carbohydrate sources wouldn't work for you I remember you guys might to the targo experiment just Justin Harris and Steve Cuculo and they both said that they tried to load on the targo and it just felt like this massive lump of gel in their stomach and I can see that because the viscosity would have been so I mean think about how thick and nasty that would have been not enough water it just seems like it's just yeah but for whatever reason like I say the carba and I don't know why maybe it stays in solution better maybe it's just the type of carbohydrate it is but I tolerate it well so I've just always stuck with that I think it's going to come down to the molecular weight of the carbohydrate yeah yeah and I'll say this to try it for yourselves you know what I mean like because I'm thinking back 15 years there was a time that like I did buy some highly brain cyclic doxan but in order for me to buy that like I was really tapping into my finances to do that you know what I mean especially at the doses that we were running it but I could afford to nutrition's carbolode because it was like yeah God I think they have it and this is I mean it is a plug I guess it's the cheapest carb on the market you get I think it's 15 servings for $20 it's 50 grams per serving so if you do a half of serving you get 25 grams of carbs for your next you know 30 workouts like that was cheap and so I used a lot of carbolode it worked fine for me but what I was warned was hey see how it works on your digestion because it's not going to be as likely to digest as well as highly brain cyclic doxan and it was like you know what it's working for me I'm going to keep using it right so I'd say if you're in that position financially where you don't have an option don't completely sell yourself out or you know shut your I shut the idea off try it but be prepared you know what I mean that'd be my thought on it what's the most central workout carbs you ever use Scott 200 okay yeah let's I've been there yeah I haven't no I don't think that work very well for me no I've been as high as only like 90 or 100 with EA anything else I'm like I feel like I'm pregnant while I'm training yeah and then you to the the water content matters I mean I have about gallon jugs yeah exactly two two and a half liters and so it just it just it depends if I'm sweating profusely okay I might be able to move through it quicker but yeah you have to train yourself to drink that much because I don't you know for me it didn't start at 200 but you we built it over time and you got used to drinking more and more fluid because I couldn't handle the gallon intra you know and have it finished before the workout was over I think I could do 200 grams of carbs with about two and a half liters of fluid which honestly I drink that probably anyway okay I do like I keep but you know it's nothing for me to go and use the restroom two times long train I was wondering because I'm thinking the kidneys are only set up to process what about a liter an hour is that true I think so about a liter 1.25 liters an hour something to that effect okay number what it was what if you're training in Highland Park powerhouse into trade it doesn't have good AC and the same way yeah sure my amy I have this gym here I absolutely love going to busy body and train my wife will go to busy by she doesn't want to go to the other gym that's the garage style gym yeah one of the things that I don't like about busy body is they just will not use the air conditioning and I will be pouring and I don't mind pouring down sweat I'm I'm not you know where if it's dripping off me cool but if I'm training legs and I'm I mean sweats or something if I'm prepping and I want to you know get some pictures if you're pouring down sweat you don't look very good because you're not very full because you're sweating your ass off and the lighting in there is poor so there's that too with your 200 grams were you also using all the insulin in the world to work with that 200 grams as well as like I was there was a fair amount of insulin all the insulin yeah there was yeah I was going through pens pretty rapidly but I mean in fairness I think anybody listening would be like there's no way that you're gonna get to 200 grams of carbs without insulin lots of let's say actually I wasn't using pens I was using the little mini jugs of insulin yeah yeah yeah um all right let me see what else we got we'll try to wrap it fire through a couple of these anybody going to North Americans in three weeks from the time he posted this dusty's going you going oh yeah team up with dusty say hi to him yeah he's gonna be getting a workout in with uh who's he getting that is he getting a workout in with no no no no turn her riddle him and turn her riddle yeah I'm gonna say Chris doesn't go to the go to North Americans to work out yeah whatever you see Chris at any show he is just buried in his computer look something his athletes are on stage yells and then he's like right back to his computer right back to banging out work so he's telling me they're training at that LA fitness across the street oh I'm gonna go to the powerhouse powerhouse it's like 25 minutes away from the venue but um yeah so I uh I met John Jewett there and this is before John Jewett was as big as he is now and I didn't know it was John Jewett at the time and uh I worked in with him it was like hey you might if I use this back machine with you he's like I don't know go ahead and uh I looked at it and I uh I uh I adjusted it and put the weight that I needed to use and it was pretty heavy for me at the time and I put it down he was like he jumps in and he took the pin and was like dude like seven down and like and I was like okay I remember thinking I was like okay this bro is gonna have some pretty wacky form here with that much weight like he's gonna start I get ready to see this dude start yanking this shit you know no perfect form perfect technique and then afterwards uh my girlfriend was like hey I think that was John Jewett you're training in with and I was like really I was like I think you're right I'm terrible with faces in person you know what I mean yeah so yeah then I met him like a week after that or something that was some some time ago nice uh yeah team up with does I know was sometime ago because you referenced your girlfriend yeah yeah I've got a couple clients I'm probably gonna meet up with out there so okay I love that show man oh it was good to me last year I had three pro cards hell yeah dude so get the cinnamon rolls at 350 bakery I don't need junk food man I'm just telling you you have to oh that's a good way of friends I don't know what to tell you but there's sticky buns and cinnamon rolls are some of the best I've ever had 350 bakery 350 bakery yeah they were think about 10 12 minutes to get there it's up in the hills a little bit everything is yeah everything everything takes 20 minutes to get to even if you're five minutes away in three bridges yeah you're going like this and you're going back across the bridge again just take a right turn it's like what you're like I it's the crow flies I should be there by now yeah oh good friend of the show IFBB Pro page she says a question for the next episode can you guys talk about your approaches to training during peak week also that's okay I didn't need a shout out for the Tampa Pro 100% kidding I'm still honored and you recognized me and said hi bad stage when I was pumping up to go out for figure listen she looked freaking incredible she hit a great I think this is her first was this her first pro season no yeah she did I believe the Chicago and then she did the Tampa and I if I'm not mistaken she I don't know if she did Texas stuff but I think she probably did if I saw the the other day the Atlanta show I'm gonna try to make a mental note to drop a picture of her in here I'm sorry very pretty very pretty from the look fantastic universe so very improved I saw her at the Arnold very off season at that point but she was like looking like she put on some size pages from Milwaukee yeah yeah yeah so if she is listening please have a duck fat burger for me at wild at wild roots in Milwaukee but you're probably propping and dieting to boring but if you're not get a duck get a duck fat burger for me I feel like any contact with skip is like hey great to see you get your out and so and so make sure you get go to this restaurant I haven't been I haven't been there for while I haven't been able to visit the kids and we're supposed to go a couple weeks ago so now I got to wait a month because they're moved one of our daughters bought a new bought a new house right next door to their other house oh but it has like this guest house yeah what was that I'm just having a lot of spasms that I was like what's up with the guest house I just moved my arm or anything anyway and it comes in a ghost thankfully but they bought the house next to it has a guest house so and my other daughter the two are graduating together from the University of Wisconsin next June and or next May and they're going to rent the guest house so they're gonna they're that tight because at first I was like that's a bad idea you guys are gonna be way too close but they're soup they're like BFFs growing up they weren't but they are now so they're moving next door we're gonna visit them as soon as they move in nice nice all right so so peak week training philosophies or you know training systems what do you guys what do we all suggest for that Lex I'd call it stretching stretching squeeze it's just it's um I don't know what do you want to call it like vanity shit pump it post yeah there you go there you go pump it post I mean that's the time you wear your tank top and you know your workouts are of actual training is 45 minutes tops and you just get a good pump making sure you look good in the mirror you're not testing anything out you're not you know no matter how strong you feel because you're all loaded up that's not the time to do your max hack squad or well you shouldn't really I like to pull leg training about two weeks out maybe a touch up quad hamstring day eight to seven days out but and that's for women too with the exception of like the bikini ball in this class of course um because you know figure you want to have that quad separation so I wouldn't be doing any hard like stuff after I'll say the latest is like 10 days out but uh yeah pump and pose really you should be spending more time in your posing working through your posing routine making sure your your your quarter turns are perfect and um that's where a lot of your energy should be actually towards the end of that prep towards the the last 10 to all days yep I don't have much to add there you want to go into the gym get a pump get out before you do something stupid you also don't want to deplete yourself to the point where you're just making it harder for your coach to fill you back out right this is the time to do endless workouts just because it feels good and you look good just enough because you're not building any muscle in those last 10 days no and you're not like etching in anything in you're not etching you know yeah yeah all right I'm waiting you guys a hundred percent on that I think that's a great place to call it this is a fun show I hope you guys enjoyed the reaction hangout that we did I had a fun time doing it I hope you guys did you guys like that yeah yeah all right well everybody home and his noise was his video was a little loud I don't know if the viewers are going to be able to hear us on that I think that it's the so post-production skip it all is on several channels so I can adjust that but I've noticed too that sometimes when we do it's just bodybuilding reacts that one of us it's usually like

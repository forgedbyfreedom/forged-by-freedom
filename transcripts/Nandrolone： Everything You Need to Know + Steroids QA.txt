 As an Andro, and part of the No 19 family, it has a strong binding affinity, which means it attaches to the straps very strongly. And that in part is what gives it its strength in building muscle tissue, its signaling capability within to the receptors very, very good. I feel like I get a stronger punch in my experience from MPP than I do from DACA. DACA is kind of a slower burn. It's that 4 to 5 to 6 re-exwerves really feeling like it's built up. Versus MPP, I feel like it's kind of up and running within just a few weeks. And I think from a psychological point of view that has a massive impact on how effective people perceive books to be, because I think when people feel like they're on, they respond both in better dire adherence, harder training, more intensity and more focus.

And we're of course brought to you by patreon. I got to get my spiel out, you know, Dave, we missed last week. You missed hanging out with Rick Collins. We did get a little update from him, by the way. And the main topic today, we're going to talk about lowest effective dose of nangirlome. We're going to talk about Deca versus NPP. And we're just going to dig into that one. We've got all your listener questions. You guys are welcome to comment with questions below. But yeah, so last week, Dave, what you missed out on was we talked to Rick Collins. And he he did allude to there being more pressure from the US on China regarding Ross. He said, Hey, listen, you know, I of course, the law enforcement doesn't tell me what their plans are. He said, but you know, I am privy to conversations with people in the DEA and law enforcement in general. And he said, from my understanding, they are more interested in the supply from China than they've ever been. And they want to try to do what they can to maybe not pressure them not to sell to the US. So thanks to you. We're all suffering. What do you mean? Thanks to me. You represent America as far as he's concerned. Oh, so it's because of me. Yes, this is what you're telling me. Yes. Oh, you also too missed the fourth of July. Did you do anything to celebrate our independence from your people? Did I do anything for you mutiny you mean and and revolting against your masters? We do fireworks to celebrate the day we left Dave's place. Yeah, we do fireworks the day you left to. I actually did sort of yes. Oh, good. Good. There's a big car show called Stars and Stripes, which is on once a year. It's basically a celebration of America. No, cool. But mainly featured around vehicles. And I went to that on the Sunday and it pissed it down and I got so wet through. But yes. So you got to see some cool American muscle cars. Yeah, yeah. To me, honestly, it wasn't. Hmm. Of recent years. And I think the weather was the problem because you don't get the real heavy custom stuff that comes out when it's really bad weather, but you get a lot of the. So there's there's you get a lot of the stock stuff. So you get a lot of Mustangs and Camaro's and stuff like that, but you don't get the real different stuff unless the weather's really good. Which is fine, but yeah, it's still all right. I mean, we normally go and do the weekend, but we haven't had the time to do it for a couple of years, but we're hoping to get back to it next year. But yeah, last week was a bit of a nightmare. There's a vehicular issues. So yeah, that's why Dave wasn't with us. He got trapped on the road as his vehicle broke down and we're glad you could beat it back though. I fixed it. I broke down three times. Oh, God. That is not a fun scenario. So let's dig into it, man. The main topic of the day is, and we had this question on the last episode. Somebody asked us, hey, what's the lowest dose effective dose of normal for growing muscle? You know, you said if I'm running a test base and when he says test base, I assume he means either T or T or, you know, a little bit above that, but he's got the minimal amount of test that he feels is like good for growing muscle, probably outside of the norm. And he wants to add the least amount of Nangelo and he can to get a decent effect from it. All right. Well, we've got two formats. We've got NPP or Nandrolohn Fennel propinate and we have Nandrolohn decanate, also known and commonly referred to as Decker, which is the slang name we use for Nandrolohn. You what the numbers didn't you have pulled them up? Is that the end of the world, right? But like, we had helps us understand the basics, like the anabolic ratio. What is the anabolic ratio? What does that even mean? 125 to 37. So a lot of people think these are literal numbers. They're not the just and to be fair, you could argue they're outdated now as well. But they give you a sort of rough indication of where it sits comparatively to over drugs for its stress strength and muscle building properties. The irony of this is that Decker on paper is a crap drug. But in reality, it's a great mass bill. And so in this scenario, they're not particularly great. Now I've seen studies around Decker, I mean, Decker, not so much now, but was used as a treatment frosted process for women. Okay. Hey, back up, though, just a second. When you say, what did you say the numbers were again? 135 over 37. So 125. So 125 anabolic and 37. So on paper, this would be slightly better than test from a muscle building. Testosterone, you're sparse. No, no, no, what's the anabolic ratio? Just 100 to 100. Okay. And I wanted to get that out there because that's our foundation. Yeah. Like everything's compared against. Yeah. Now, on paper, this would that would say that Decker is slightly better at building muscle, but not very good in the strength department. But as we know, the reality of that isn't true. Yeah. It's a very good muscle component. And it's actually quite decent for strength. A lot of, it's a foundation of a lot of offseason powerlifting programs and strongman programs. So there's definitely plenty of under all evidence to show that Decker supports good quality strength building. As an Andro, and part of the No 19 family, it has a strong binding affinity, which means it attaches to the rest of very strongly. And that in part is what gives it its strength in building muscle tissue, its signaling capability within to the receptor is very, very good. Okay. So the angiogenic side, so you're saying like strength is one thing, but then also side effects like hair growth, you know, acne, those type of things are more related to that angiogenic side. So you're getting and hair loss, you know, you're getting less of those viralizing side effects, so more of the anabolic effects. Yeah. And now Decker, from an instant stress point of view on the body is actually quite mild. So it converts to DHN, which is not as impact as DHT. So we don't see massive increases in our production. We don't generally see hair loss. So I'll do the positives on the negatives. It increases collagen synthesis and it's a projecting, which means it stimulates, like it acts like a projecting, it's not a true progesterine, which means it stimulates a progesterine receptor. The downstream effect of all that is that it can help with joints and joint inflammation and it helps produce a natural anti-inflammatory that helps with joint management. So you're not generally going to, it does convert to eschogen, but only at the rate of 20% of that testosterone. So it's not hugely aromatizing drug. And generally you will see bloods half decent when you're on Decker. On the negative side, it has some quite direct negative impacts to the heart. It has quite an impact on brain chemistry and can cause anxiety and depression in users. It lowers dopamine transport proteins, which means the dopamine is not getting across to the receptor in the same way in the brain and effectively acts like you've got low dopamine. That causes an other patient's impollactin, which can lead to things like erectile issues and lactation. So it does have other things and it's particularly a derivative of memory. So it can't really affect your memory as well. So there's the pluses and minus. I personally like Decker. I'm a big fan and I feel that though it does have these negative impacts, it is very dose duration driven. Yeah. And for most people, they're not going to be hugely impacting. There's been studies shown that a 50 milligram dose of Decker added into a TRT protocol or in the case of females with no other protocol has improved ligament integrity, joint integrity and has lowered overall joint pain and inflammation. And there's been research though I'm not aware of the result side of this into Decker being used as a supportive compound in injury repair and injury recovery. It's got a long standing reputation within the user community that it's general on joints and helps joints. And that is in part why it's popular in the strength sports because it gives those joints some extra boost. In part, some of the manufacturers I said is down to increased collagen synthesis. From a doseing point of view, Decker's a really weird one. I like moderately low testosterone with actually relatively high Decker. So sort of 253, 100 test bases and sort of 7, 900 even a gram of Decker. Now what I found with a lot of people, and this is not across the board, but what I found with a lot of people is that the lower dose Decker gives them size, but when they push the dose higher, those sides dissipate. Which doesn't make sense, you know. No. And I think what it is. And I don't know for facts that this is all just summarisation and guesswork to a degree educated guesswork I'd like to think. I think it's to do with DHN. DHN is a weaker metabolite downstream from 5 alpha reductase than test is to DHT. But I think when you get the levels high enough, that DHN negativity reduces because it's just so much of it. Yeah. I think there's an over-compensation factor here that even though DHN is much weaker than DHT, if you get a lot higher enough, you can get enough of it. Yeah. So I think there's something there. It's definitely not for everybody. I know a few people who can't get on with it at all. One we were talking about just before we went on air. Oh, OK. But yes. Like I say, so it's one of them drugs that you really got to suck it and see, unfortunately. But I would have said if you were looking at a NANDRALO and DECA-NAY, so a DATE traditional DECA, or DECA-08 to be exact, excuse my shitty pronunciation, because I'm sure you'll pull me up on it in a minute's go. I would probably say you're looking at 200 milligames. NPP, I think you can get away with 50, three times a week. OK, so 150, little less NPP to get a muscle building benefit with it. OK, hey, on that note of DHN, so just to clarify, and to point another aspect out to any of our listeners, so testosterone breaks down into DHT as one of the byproducts and with metabolites with NANDRALO, one of the metabolites is DHN, breaks down same system. But if you use a 5AR blocker like finasteride, you're not going to get that reduction. So that DECA, which is normally going to be more gentle on the hairline, it's no longer the case because now instead of having DHN attacking the scalp, which is milder than DHT, now you have direct DECA, which is going to be from what I understand, because I've asked a lot of people about this in the consensus has been that DECA on the hairline is more harsh than DHT on the hairline. You will have a greater effect. I don't know. But I don't actually, first time I've heard that myself to be honest. I've talked to a lot of people who've said because they've said, well, hey, watch out because if you're using finasteride, then you no longer have that breakdown to DHN, which is gentle on the hairline, you have the direct DECA now that is going to potentially affect the hairline and you will get more shedding. So just keep that in mind for anybody that is using a 19 or I wanted to throw that out there. So 150 dosing wise for minimal effective dose of NPP 200 for DECA. Now it's said that even though it's interesting, the final propane ester isn't usually when we get to faster acting compounds, the shorter ester, the faster ester is much smaller. Takes up less room. So you have more hormone, like if you use test ACE, I can't remember what the number is, but it's like, we'll call it 90 something percent of that 100 milligrams. It's going to be something of it is going to be actual testosterone versus DECA. It's pretty low, like 62 milligrams per 100 milligrams. Yeah, you feel like 38, 40% of the cannowate ester. Yeah, but then with final propane, even though that is somewhat faster, it's not fast fast, but it's somewhat faster. You still don't get that much more nangelone in the nangelone phenopropane preparation. So I find that interesting too, considering it is looked at generally as being a faster acting compound. Do you think you could get away with less frequent shots of nangelone phenopropane than we generally use? Yeah. Because it's often used three times a week to every other day. Yeah, I can see two times a week potentially. Two a week, yeah, I can see two a week. I mean, it's sort of four or five day half-life. So yeah, two a week would work quite well. And yeah, no, I mean, there's just no real argument with that. I prefer it slightly more frequently. Me too. I prefer a lower dose, but more frequent with MPP than I would less frequent than a slightly high dose. But then I actually like running the two together. There you go. Somebody else mentioned then in the stream said, I like mixing short asters with long asters, keeps the juice flowing through the blood. I can't get anything scientific. It's just a personal experience that I've found, Decker and MPP together gave me an effect that was greater than the individual parts. Yeah, I can see that. I'm a fan of nangelone phenopropane with EQ, and we've talked about that. But I definitely feel like I feel like I get a stronger punch in my experience from MPP than I do from Decker. Decker is kind of a slower burn. It's that four to five to six weeks where it's really feeling like it's built up. Versus MPP, I feel like it's kind of up and running within just a few weeks. And I think from a psychological point of view, that has a massive impact on how effective people perceive drugs to be, because I think when people feel like they're on. Yeah. They respond both in better diet, adherence, harder training, more intensity and the more focus. When a drug is so gradual that you don't really feel it kicking in, I think it doesn't always lead to people getting the most out of what they're doing because they just don't feel like, I mean, I had this conversation with a client last week. He was like, I don't really feel like I'm on. I'm not really. And it's like, well, it shouldn't be the drugs that force you to train hard. That should be a mental state you're already in. The drugs should just allow for faster recovery and therefore a rapid repeat of that level of intensity. But, yeah, I mean, I do think there's a big psychological impact here on how people respond to drugs by how they feel off the drug. I will say this. I definitely feel some good strength from Deca. When I'm, you know, and it's not like the same kind of strength that you get from like a powerful antigen like trend or halo. But it's a solid kind of stronger in the 10 rep range or 20 rep range. You know what I mean? It's the only way, if you want to describe it in a real layman's terms, it's like that extra reps always there. It doesn't make it any fucking easier. I mean, you'll be you'll be checking like a shiting dog getting it out, but you'll get it out. And then you'll go down and even though that last rep told everything in your head, there isn't another one in there. It still is another one in there. If you go for it, it still comes. Whereas something like trend, you're banging them, you know, they're just bam, bam, bam, bam, bam. Whereas I think we decorate it. It really, you really do have to just keep committing that if you get a rep, you go for the next one. And they seem to be extremely hard for to win, but they are there to win if you, if you actually commit to them. Yeah, I could see that. I remember Dave, I don't think I ever mentioned this to you before early on in me researching gear and like learning about what the different compounds were. I remember in an issue of muscular development came out and it was John Romano had a small article about Nangelone and he said he was like, I know. And he told this story. He was like, I know that Deca is kicking in when I'm on the leg press and my legs just feel like pistons pumping out wrap after rep after rep. And then he went on to tell the story of like the Deca is kicking in and I was out on a four wheeler and I saw this guy with his girlfriend who their quad got stuck. And he was like, I use my super human Deca strength to help lift that thing out. And I know that the girlfriend was impressed. It was like this whole tale that he told of the first time he ran Deca or you know, some Deca cycle that he ran. I was like, yeah, I can get with that. Now unlike you, I'll tell you what, I really just didn't feel great on Deca and maybe it was the amount of tests I used because honestly, I had always used more tests than anything else years ago, you know, 20 years ago, there was always a thought of, you know, run your test 100 milligrams or 200 milligrams higher than your Deca. I always followed that now post contest my first cycle back into my off season one year. I had run EQ a bunch through the past off season and I thought I need to do something different, which I really didn't, but I thought like got to hit the receptors differently Dave. So I ran 800 Deca with a thousand test and I'll tell you what, man, I grew muscle, but I just never felt good that whole cycle long and maybe it had to do with what you were talking about affecting the dopamine transport proteins. You know, I found that I've had clients tell me that they haven't felt mentally great on Deca, like something was just lacking. We had a listener who first pointed this whole thing out to me because he said he was using a minute, we talked about this a few times before running a powerful ADHD medication that all of a sudden he felt like he needed a higher dose while on Nangelo and Phenoproponine to get the same effect that he had been getting from that prescription medication. So definitely something to look out for. Yeah. You know what I'm gonna say on that point, the weird thing is I've had a lot of contradictory from people on those types of meds saying that they really get on well with Deca and it seems to work well with them within that situation so people that have ADHD and such like. So I honestly don't know. The one thing we haven't touched on actually, which we should have done. Okay. Deca is not great for fertility. Yeah. There is that. It does have a very big impact on sperm morphology. So you can offset a two degree by supplement with touring. But yeah, if you're in a fertility sort of realms, then it's a drug that's stay away from because it does tend to mess the sperm's the ups a little bit. And 19 gn in general tend to kind of shut you down pretty, pretty quickly, right? Yeah, just there's several aspects of sperm. So you've got morphology, you've got mobility and you've obviously got sperm count. Sperm counts quite obvious, hasn't it? The number of sperm. Mobility is how well those fuckers can swim. And morphology is how mutated they are. And the higher the morphology, the more we shape and the sperm is and that then affects sperm's ability to enter the egg. So you end up with loads of sperms with flat foreheads and when they hit the egg while they bounce off. So basically guys, if you're running Dekka, you don't have to worry about birth control with your lady. Oh, no, no. Don't go that far, right? No, I have one child, messed up child. So I actually have somebody to do with the Dekka. Oh, damn. I have one child that's Dekka born. Dekka born child. All right. Well, we hope that helps you guys out. We gave out some minimal effective dose as what he was looking for. Last episode of muscle mines, Scott looked at a research paper that showed 100 milligrams of Dekka was effective for giving your joints an additional kind of soothing benefit. Is that from, there's a, I believe like an anti-inflammment effect to it as well? Yeah. I've seen some stuff at 50 milligram trials for joint support and injury. And I know, actually, no quite a few more senior users that have added it into TRT protocols and have said that it's been very beneficial. But yeah, there was, there was definitely some stuff going on around Dekka in the form of using it for injury, recovery and such like at that 50 to 100 milligrams sort of dosage. So yeah, I think if you're looking at Dekka as a complimentary antibiotic, then you're going to be 50 max 100 and, I say, I think if you're looking for it as something that's going to help you grow, then you're going to be 200 plus. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I'd agree with you there. All right. Well, listen, if you guys have any more questions on that topic, definitely hit us up. I feel like we could keep trying to dig in a little further and a little further, but we do have a bunch of listener questions that we wanted to get to. And you guys are welcome to comment on this show with questions and we will tackle them on the next, the next show. Why hello? I wanted to do something different with my true nutrition advertisement for today. And here's the thing I just got our order in. Victoria and I, we pay for all the protein that we get. They don't send us anything for free. And that's because I've believed in true nutrition for 15 years now. I've been using them ever since I contest prep. They have some of the cleanest, best quality protein. A lot of times I use the team skip, but here's the deal. I'm going back to the pure weight isolate. Pure weight isolate, it just processes so fast. This is my favorite flavor, chocolate peanut butter cup. But if you want to try just like one pound at a time, you can do that. Just sample it. I've never had the cookie butter. So I'm going to try the cookie butter this week. I've got a big old bag, a pea protein isolate for the wife. This is what she likes to use. And here's the thing, they're just about wholesale prices at true nutrition. Plus, they don't add the flavor in when they weigh it. So you get like legit one pound of protein and then from there they add the flavor after that. So every one pound, I think it's like one point two. I'm not sure. Don't quote me on that. But hey, here's the thing. The true nutrition is a great quality protein. They believe in us. They advertise with us because I literally ask them to. And if you use our code, think you'll get some additional savings. Plus, of course, that's like voting for our podcast. So thank you guys. I hope you enjoyed my, my improv to add. Goodbye. We try to get to everything. But if we don't get to one of your questions, it's nothing personal. We just, you know, so many come in and you want to make sure that you're commenting on the latest show when it comes out because then we tackle that within the next couple of days to record for the following show. So if you record on one that was like from last year, chances of getting it on the show are going to be a lot lower. So all right, we have enough time on this one for this guy because he just posted it a day ago. He says, question for Dave. I'm traveling to London for 10 days. Will I face any issues at Heathrow? If I carry 20 tablets of farm grade ox, what's he got here? Oxygen's alone, 10 milligrams for personal use. I do not have a prescription. So you shouldn't. Now there is a couple of problems here. Technically you're allowed to bring them in at the art personal use. There's no crime committed, etc, etc, etc. That doesn't always mean that the board of control officer knows the law and they can get a little bit triggered up it. But I would suspect that you have no problems in my usage days. I traveled back and forth with a squishantly larger amounts of antibiotics on me that were still personal use. But when you're using a 10 mil away, you need a couple of models with you when you travel. So yes, I don't see you for seeing any problems. I'd stick it in your whole luggage and I wouldn't be concerned about it. I'd also take it out of the box or whatever that says anFR and maybe put it in another bottle too. I don't know. You could. There's something to be said for being, you know, this there is there. Look, I know it's legal in this country, it's personal use. You know, the worst case scenario they're going to take them off you and say, look, you can't have them bugger off. Call Dave. Call Dave. Call Dave. Call them way to put the fucking selves. All right. Oh, we did have a question from angry listener. That's his name now. You remember angry listener? Oh, I was it. Yeah. You're right. He says, would Deca, so this is a follow up to our Deca stuff, would Deca affect people differently if there's a pre existing chemical imbalance in the brain for me, it seems to make me more docile and less aggressive. I don't know as much about get up. I don't know as much to get upset. It's nice. Okay. Yeah, that was my whole point. It seems to be that people that do have slightly unusual brain chemistry, I think, is a nice way of pointing it or different brain chemistry can't get on with it really, really well. And I've had a number of clients that are under some form of mental health treatment that I've swore by using Deca that they really get on well with it and make some feel better. They feel more stable. They feel less impulsive. It was less dopamine. I wonder if that gives way because so dopamine and serotonin are like a gang gang. I don't know because it's not that dopamine itself is lower. You're just getting less use out of the dopamine, but if dopamine were lower, then that would encourage serotonin to be higher. Well, now, do you know God, his name's gonna aren't me yet? He had cerebral attacks here. He competed his disabled strongmer. Well, I'm not sure. I have spoken about him. I've got a completely mental broken membrane. He's passed now, unfortunately. But he used a lot of Deca. And whilst on Deca, he managed to read, now bear in mind, his pain was nerve-al-driven. He was able to significantly reduce his pain medication. Oh, yeah, yeah, okay. And his consultants were like, well, I mean, I'm not sure if he was able to do that. I mean, this is gonna sound quite harsh, but they're actually going to die anyway. It's only a matter of time. You know that, we know that. So anything you do that might not be good on paper, that helps your situation and makes you feel better and manages your pain better, crack on with it. So they were quite supportive of him using Deca. And he really got on well with it. I would do not be a veteran there once before. Okay. Hey, what about this one? And we have talked about this before from Frost. He says, Dave and Scott, what are your top three over the counter supplements that you'd recommend for someone on gear excluding Criatin? And he wrote it out that way. Criatin. Yes, guys, Criatin. Besides that, get support max from stream. Yeah, if you want to hold in one, then support max. Yeah, if we're looking at all in one, definitely, I'd say support max. If we're looking at individuals, I would be a lipid support. Yep. Potentially a bit D. Yeah. And potentially a bit C. Lipid support. So what's lipid support though? Because that's not one supple. So if you're looking, all right, if we're going away and we're going to go individual, so I would look at something that's going to support HDL levels, but it's something like Citrus Burger Mark, Criloil or something of that nature, I would be less focused on LDL levels and I would manage that more through diet. Whereas supporting HDL through diet gets difficult when you're on antibiotics and it does depend on the type of antibiotics as well because some are more adulterative than others. Agreed. Vity always gets used in excess for anabolic, so it's always useful to increase Vity. And Vitsy is a very nice antioxidant. Which also supports HDL. So Vitsy would be the... I'll go with A and B. I'm going to swap out the vitamin C for something else. Maybe another antioxidant like NAC, maybe. It's a hard stretch for me to say everybody needs glutathione, but NAC is a fairly inexpensive supplement. I do like the idea of an all-in-one like support Mexican. And by the way, I mentioned this because I have been researching the product now. Like I've been looking into the strom stuff. And no, it's not a product that has like super top end dosing on everything across the board that's in it. But there is going to be some synergy out of having a pretty good dose of this and a pretty good dose of this that they both do, you know, they both provide health in the same way. And you're spending, you know, the same amount you would have spent on a bottle of trend. So it's not like you need to buy, you know, $500 worth of supplements for the next, you know, coming back. That's one of the things one of the ethosus behind support, Max, was making it cost effective. So yes, you could, you could compensate around certain ingredients being doseed at higher levels. But it was that balance of keeping the cost in a position where it was affordable against effectiveness. And that was why it ended up how it was. That makes sense. I don't. And there is a synergy. There is a synergy between multiple things that do overlap, you know. Yeah. And I don't, I think you'll struggle to get better value for money. I think it's probably the best way of putting that. Dave, with you mentioned using a high dose BPC the other week, somebody wanted to know if you were using liplized, like standard liplized BPC for that. I said you probably were, but that I was. Yes, it was. Yes, it was. Okay. And he says I have early CKD and slightly reduced EGFR and would like to try this, but I have never administered anything IV before I'm guessing it is very high purity that that would be the priority here. So the IV is not necessary. I chose to do the IV, which was how it was administrative in the studies that I'd looked at around kidney support for BPC use. I know Andy Bolton saw increases in his EGFR and improvements in his kidney function post transplant when he used it to help with an injury. So the injectable format is still viable. Yeah. Not going to be as effective, but it is definitely still viable. And even the oral format would be viable to offer some low level kidney support. In my scenario, obviously I had an EGFR in 20. It all depends where as EGFR rates. You know, if it's just below 60, then I would probably just go for oral to be quite honest. But if he's at the more severe end of things, then the IV is going to help more. I would pick I am still just because you're going to get more into your bloodstream. Without effective. And to stepping it up to IV, you were in a medical setting. You legit have a clinic, right? And it's not something I would necessarily think would be as safe to practice at home without all the proper equipment and preparations. You know, no, I wouldn't. If you're going to go the IV route, you need, you know, you need the medical expertise to be able to deliver it correctly and safely. Whereas for most people, the easiest administrations, if you're going to be injectable or oral, they both will have some effectiveness. What if we ask Dave for life advice and he can respond with his infinite wisdom? Well, I think it's a great idea, but you should also ask some life advice for us. But that would be a great way to do Dave's wisdom, Uncle Dave's wisdom. You know what I mean? You don't have to think of something, you don't have to make something up every week. We give you something to talk on. I think that's a great idea. You guys are welcome to comment with that stuff. We've been here before and he's sort of tried old, didn't it? It was early on. We did a segment called Uncle, no, ask Davey. There was somebody in the UK that did like a love letters thing and we were asking for relationship advice. And it was funny because you were still like 415 Dave basically. So there's like big 415 Dave or the microphone given love advice to people. And there was a comedy to that for sure that was good. Ask Dave, did he ever compete in a bodybuilding show? A few episodes ago, I swear he said he did. As a natural junior, yes. Okay, okay. I didn't remember if you had or not. How old were you? 14. Okay, how'd you do? I was 14. I was 14 stone three on stage. I don't know what a stone is, Dave had 12 pounds. I'm too lazy to maths this today, hang on. 14 times. Just today. £199 on stage. Okay. Okay. I hated your whole. Yeah, 18 or high three. 19. I hated every second of it. Okay. Um, I just wanted to know if 2 IU GH is effective at 23 years old or is that just a replacement dose? It depends on quality GH. If farming, I would say probably yes, if generic, I would say it's going to be you on a good tape. Yeah. I'd say this, I feel like so the older we get, the more effective a replacement dose of GH is going to become because our GH isn't that great at 23 years old. So they now everybody's different, right? And out the gate, everybody's GH production is going to be different. But they say that on average 35 years old is your cutoff date where things are no longer improving after 35. They are only going downhill. So at 35, maybe you'd benefit from 2 IU, but then at 40, you'd benefit it from it even more and at 50 or 60, you might even get greater benefit. I would say while dieting, growth hormone tends to be lower, testosterone tends to be lower, you may find more benefit from it while in like a strong deficit at a very lean body fat. And maybe it might help you to stay leaner if you were, say, really pushing the food, but see for yourself. And if you don't notice a difference, then maybe you need to go to three or four IU would be my thought, you know. Yeah. I mean, if you want to see the benefits of GH, I don't know the gentleman, just look at Scott. I mean, he's 60 and look at look at how radiant he's. Hey, wait, I was 57 just a month ago, Dave. How did I get from 57 to 60 now? All right. Thank you, Dave and Scott. Question for you. That was the duck in an angel on MPP one. Scott, what's your say? What you're saying is MP, excuse me, MK677 along with abombs to comment appetite suppression on oxys. Huh. I don't know about that, but what do you think Dave? Not really. I have, yeah, it can help. Yeah. Yeah, he can offset it to a degree. It again, he's going to be very person dependent, but yes, he can do something. I still have these modern MK sitting here now. I don't know what I'm going to do with it, Dave, because I drove my hunger up like wild man. I can't re-believe how strong of an appetite strengthening effect that had on me. So yeah, I'm not touching it for some time. I have a question. Yeah. What does your sweatshirt say? It says hard AF. That's swearing. What does your shirt say? Nothing. It's got a picture. Is that a crow on it, by the way? Yeah. It's an angry crow. An F must be earned. I can't just walk around with a bucket of F's handing them out for free. Does that say there? If I feel like you've earned it, I will give an F. That's not an appropriate shirt, Dave, to be wearing on a podcast or out in public or in the workplace. That is not an appropriate workplace shirt and you're in the workplace right now. I'm waiting about out of the way to share the parents even. You'd wear it what? To parents even. Oh, I bet you would. I bet you would. Do you remember Epistane? Yes. It says, do things like Epistane still have a place for recreational lifters, seen some very similar to Orals? It was very similar to Orals like Anivar or Terinna Ball, but I am probably way off. Yeah. Had you ever used it? Never even seen it in real life. I had used it. There was a great deal of popularity to it back in the message board days and there was a guy who had the raw powders available of that and a couple of there like pro hormones before the ban and all that. You could buy the raw powders from him and I did that and I measured it out and I never saw anything like I couldn't tell you anything Dave. Like I didn't notice a single bit, but then I heard people say like, oh, yeah, I've gotten great experiences with it. Is it even available now? Yeah. I'm sure you can get it somewhere. There's got to be some underground place that's still slinging some up to stand. I mean, with the legislation changes around those sort of compounds, it just seems pointless to go through the risk of producing that when you can just produce a double or whatever else. Yeah. I've heard an AI like effect from it too, I believe, or something. It just like it was so unimpressive that I never bother looking into it further and then I've heard listeners though. I bet you guys, if you're listening right now and you've had a great experience with Epistane, tell us all about it because I know you're out there. I've heard you guys talk about it, but to me, and it's just there's other routes to go. The hardcore pro hormone guys are almost on a level with vegans. There is that, isn't there? There's fewer of them around today though. But yeah, they would never be long before they tell you. What about this one for older guys doing safer, quote unquote, safer TRT plus cycles? What are your comments unmasked in primo health impacts on the prostate? Primo was designed to be more prostate friendly. So I don't know any exact dates on it, but I would often talk to my head suspect that primo probably won't be too bad. Massed I'm not sure. Massed is a less refined DHT than primo, so probably there's going to be some negativity from massed. DHT's in general, I found can be a bad combo for guys that, so it's not everybody, but it does tend to be the older guys and that some fewer older guys that do experience like in large prostate, especially with gearing DHT's in general. Hey, we've talked about dose and duration being a big part of it too. Yeah, I mean, the development of primo bolem was to create a DHT that has had less negative DHT side effects. So it was specifically developed to try and create a DHT that wasn't particularly prostate nasty or wasn't particularly follicle nasty. And obviously it wasn't a complete success, but again, it does boil down to the individual sensitivities on those fronts as to how you're going to react with it. And those, you know, you take two gram of primo, you're going to fucking problems out. Yeah. All right. Hi guys, I'm on test e, trend e, and drost. I like the way you put that master on e for 10 weeks now. Started it to 50 tests 100 trend, 100 massed once a week. And at eight weeks, I wasn't feeling or noticing a lot. So I doubled the dose. How long do you think I can stretch it because I only wanted to do 10 weeks to see the results, but the last two weeks, so it finally seems to be working and showing some results. Any advice? Stop and go to TRT for a while. Then or keep going for a while. Most likely, most likely most of us enthusiasts. I like most of us enthusiasts. I don't have blood work. I know, I know. I don't know if he's like most enthusiasts. A lot of guys are getting labs now. So you started out at 250 tests. Yeah, I'm just doing 120. Did eight weeks on a low dose didn't get much of it. Double the dose has done two weeks. Oh, yeah. I would say probably got away with another four. And then I'd be off the market up to experience. Yeah, you know, you can come back on next time at a dose that's going to be effective for you, right? Yeah. I don't think that's a bad idea at all. But I'd also recommend getting some labs, you know. It's not expensive. It is getting more. I don't know, Dave, if it changed over there, but there was recently a hike in prices. I noticed over at Merrick, it was like all of a sudden their non-sensitive estrogen was $10 before. And now it jumped up to 30. Their test and free test was less expensive. I think it was 20, 30. And now it like doubled. Yeah, we're fighting price increases. We get increased pressure. I think what people, there's a lot of, I can only speak from where we are, but there's a lot of costs involved that people probably don't regret it. So consumable, so I've gone up. So tubes, needles, swabs, cleaning equipment, all that's increased. Lab prices have been stable, but there's been, I know they wanted to put prices up. Obviously, labor prices have gone up as cost of living has gone up, but the one that really stings is stuff like insurance. And believe me, stuff like postage. It's a big part of our operation. And we've had four postage increases in the last couple of years. And our insurance costs have easily doubled in the last two years. Yeah. So there is pressure on margins, definitely. So it doesn't surprise me that loves us to have no surprises. And particularly around stuff like sensitive estrogen, where the marketplace is not great, the thing that makes testing cheap is volume. OK. So if labs are doing a lot of volume, then other certain tests, then they can knock it out relatively cost effectively. When they have to do tests that aren't frequent, then they become expensive. So that's where you'll usually first see price increases is on the less popular testing. So stuff like sensitive estrogen would be one that doesn't surprise me that it's gone up at all. It's struggling in the UK to find any way that's doing it. There are so many people in the US doing labs. I mean, I think the volume that America is doing, for instance, is massive. Just massive. You know, there are some kind of like, I don't know, it just, it seems like I go to quest and I get labs done privately. And I know what the prices are to do that. But then if I get the same labs done through my insurance, they charge my insurance like five times as much. And I still end up paying like, what I would have paid if I would have just done it privately, you know, after my insurance covers a huge chunk of it. It's ridiculous, man. The medical system is just, it's not there to help us. That's for sure. No, it's, yeah, when she starts going to involve prices to tend to astronomically all of a sudden increase for no friggin' reason. The US does about best way to fix bicep tendinitis due to pectoral muscle tightness outside of BPC 157. And I sent him a video that I have published privately on the channel that I share with clients. And just the long and the short of it is is that all of us get tight packs that, you know, especially if you're training your packs, they get tighter. And they want to pull forward like that. And when that happens, you start getting that bicep tendinitis, loosening that pack being able to fix your posture is a huge element to this. It's not, you know, people want to focus right on that bicep tendin, but it's really the pack getting into pack minor, which is under the pack being able to massage that, including then like everything through the ribs, how you're lats attached to the rib, dig for, dig for like tender points up in the armpit. There's going to be things in there that are tight. And if you loosen those up, that's good. And then there's stretches that you can get into to to stretch the packs. Yeah, I mean, removes reducing the localised tendon inflammation in the bicep tendin will short term delete, but if your pecs don't tight, it's only going to come back again. Could you not remove in the course? Yeah. So you need to deal with the cause at the same time, which is obviously tight packs. Now, this could be a mobility issue in the sense of not doing any mobility work or any stretching work. It could be a training issue in that your training is contributing to the factor. So it's important to review the background and try and address where the issues are coming from without doubt, definitely. I used to use, and I can't remember what you call it, but it's a power lifting thing. Okay. And it's a figure a really, really dense elastic webbing. The bow tie? Yeah, the bow tie. And I used to have the bow tie. Yeah, I used to use that to open myself up when I was, because like if I'm sat at desk, I tend to do this. That's not a bad idea at all, man. Yeah, if you're at a computer, you're hunched forward, you're driving a car, you're hunched forward on your phone, you're hunched forward, and you're shortening those pecs. I just found that the aftermarket stuff that's designed to do this wasn't strong enough. And the only thing that was strong enough to pull me back into line was the bow tie. Yeah, that makes total sense to me. And a great purchase. All right. I did recover this one, because I can't remember when taking a whole year to grow, do you do one gradual push for the whole year or multiple small pushes with many cuts in between? I can't remember if we did this one two weeks ago or not. You probably can't either. No. I don't think there's a right and wrong answer here, because I think it really depends on where the person is. If you're growing well, you're making good progress. I'd be reluctant to disturb that by going into a cut period unless it was a very general one, but if body fat levels are getting too high, you need to manage that as well. And you don't necessarily need to go into a dedicated cut, but you are going to need to pull calories back or at least hold calories and maybe add some extra cardio and just to stop the fat progression. It really should be a constant, a just and review situation. You know, I mean, it's why coaches ask for pictures and weigh it every week, because they want to see where you're progressing in a just calories or output if you're gaining a little bit too quick in the job department or increase if you're not gaining fast enough. So it's a constant. I don't think you particularly need to go in dedicated cut periods if you're managing your progression, but there will inevitably an end of a push be some fat gain that will need to be cleared off before you start your next push. Yeah, I'd do a cycle and then you need to spend some time holding size after that. You don't want to immediately start trying to recomb. Then, you know, after four to eight weeks when you're ready, then you can begin tightening up, preparing for the next, you know, upward push. And the key being is once you get too fat to keep gaining, that's the end of it. So I think you have more room when you're at your leanest. So one longer cycle and then from there, recover and then another cycle, but that second cycle, you usually can't push quite as hard as you did in the first one, food wise. It's not going to be as massive. It's not going to be as huge changes on the scale that second time usually. No, and I think you do need to, you do need to get to a point where you do chain really cut right back. You'll always rebound better after a period of good diet. So I agree. Here, irrespective of whether you're going to have a compete or not, there needs to be a point where you do pull right back and right down. Yeah. All right. I've heard, let's see, how about this one. What about mecha dosing melatonin as an antioxidant? Can't there be many other benefits with mecha dosing melatonin too? Dante Trudeau posted some studies showing that it can help with visceral fat loss a few years back, wondering if it's useful for PED users or bodybuilders in general, not just for sleep and circadian rhythm. We did dig into that. Scott Stevenson and I did a whole spiel on it. Back when Dante had posted that, I haven't seen it pan out in the real world, the mecha dosing of melatonin for physique changes. I don't know if you've had any experience with it. None whatsoever, but I do. When you start, ask a question. I was thinking about this is one of those where in a lab, yeah, in reality, no. Yes, sir. It is in the, I can't remember who put this together, but like the national health, it is in one of the supplements with that bug that was out. It's one of the supplements that is suggested to battle the long version of that bug, the symptoms afterward, because it is a powerful antioxidant. I went up to 30 for a while and I found that after I went to 30, I actually became dependent on it. Like if I didn't take it that night then, I was like, okay, I'm done. And then I couldn't sleep. I had to at least take 20 and then step it back down slowly. Yeah, it's what you've got to understand with a lot of this stuff. If you're not, even if it's a compound that stimulates natural production, your body will start to rely on that to the point where your own natural level of stimulation becomes redundant or low. So you can't, very often you can't just stop this shit. You've got a taper and give your body chance to adapt and adjust and come back in line. And this is what drives dependency in a lot of things. Yeah, I've always been very wary around sleep aids. I'm not saying it shouldn't be used because I think they can be a godsend, but I always think they should be used in conjunction with addressing and trying to develop mental situations that help cope with the problem. Totally agree on that. All right, see if we have anything else in the stream. Do I need SLU at 40 milligrams daily to get the full health benefits and fat burning benefits? Thanks guys and bring back Christmas cabbage. Dave, we haven't seen Christmas cabbage in a while. Where's he been? I haven't seen him in a while. Oh. He's just hanging out. Hey, Christmas cabbage guys. Welcome to the show Christmas cabbage. No, you don't need that. I'll tell you what, that in real world experience 500 micrograms has been phenomenal. Now I'm going to share this too. I've seen a lot of people using it now through talking to people listeners of the show that are also using it, seeing my own personal experience, number of clients that have wanted to use it. It is not, I wouldn't call it a fat burner by any means. It is more going to tune your body up so that it's functioning more optimally in a more optimal body, mitochondrial firing at all cylinders, improving mitochondrial function, increasing mitochondrial number. Those things are going to have a benefit to fat loss, of course, because your body's functioning better, but it's not to me like a clen or a T3 or it's not a fat burner directly from my experience. So I would not say use it as a fat burner. Some people do much better with it than others. I have seen guys take it to a thousand micrograms and get great results from it. Personally, I can't tolerate that high of a dose. It's just like I feel too spun out from it. We had a question about creatin for kids. I don't have any experience with it. If kids should take creatin, he said he had a kid who has ADHD. I looked at what he would say and the national health institute didn't say that kids should take it under 18, but I don't know, honestly. Would it be healthier than some of these serious pharmaceutical ADHD medications? Yeah, probably, but I don't know if you're going to get the same benefit as you would from that. Yeah, I know. No idea. For mental stuff. No idea. All right. Let's see what else we have here. Not sure if this has been covered, but anyone, oh, having sleep issues while blasting test. This is my first time running a gram a week, two 50 milligrams, four times per week injected. I sleep, I sleep log dog crap. I think you mean sleep like dog crap, 9 out of 10, 9 to 10 p.m. 3 night and up at 3 a.m. like clockwork. Yeah, you can fall asleep. No problem. It's five hours max, though, and then he's wide awake. Just wondering if anyone else has experience with this. Yeah, not found it uncommon with high dose tests, but all. I used to have very similar, especially in my early days of usage, if I went high on tests, it was I didn't need a lot of sleep. Yeah. Take advantage. Get up. Do some extra work. Yeah. You've used it. There's no point lying in bed fighting. It is that I mean, if you're awake, you're awake. Yeah. If you're not getting out of sleep, get up and use the time. Yeah. I did a show with Dr. Dean St. Mark a few years back. It's called Hacking Sleep with Dr. Dean St. Mark. Go watch that one if you want to understand the science behind insomnia, especially with steroid use. You may find some ways to hack that. That's going to give you much more in depth detail and information for an hour than we could answer here. In fact, I'll try to find that and put that in the description here if I remember the link to that one. But if you don't, you can easily find it easily searchable on YouTube Hacking Sleep with Dr. Dean St. Mark. Dave, before we go, we haven't had any advice or wisdom for the last two weeks. No, I don't. I feel lost without you. You're getting in either. What? I haven't gotten on. You don't have no more advice. You're all done with advice. Did we use all your advice up? Did we use up all your wisdom? Well, there wasn't a lot to start with. It really was. I mean, let's be honest. That was a pretty empty bucket before we started pouring it out. It's like squeezing a stone. Yeah. Yeah. This one's just pretty dry already, mate. You're not ringing much more. I'm probably, I'm such danger of repeating myself on stuff now that I really struggling. We need you guys to ask us from the days of release. What more uncle David's advice you have to ask him questions from here forward, guys? I mean, I've been through the mail these last couple of weeks, not in a, oh, I'm sorry. I mean, it's a cool drama, drama situation. It just works being particularly taxing and particularly difficult. And I have wanted to throw my hands in the air and have a tantrum and throw things at walls and generally just go screw you, world. I don't want anything to do with you. But you can't. And you've just got to keep logging away at it. You've got to separate the emotional to the practical. A lot of our, our responses and our difficulty around things is, is emotional responses to things. It's because we're emotional about something. If you can just look at the practicality of it, you know, what can I do to improve the situation? What can I do? How can I better plan for this, that, the other? Then you'll always get through it. I don't feel like it at the time, but you will, you'll always get through it. You've just got to keep. I remember Broderick telling me something. And it wasn't like it was something that he'd been told. So he was in Dubai. And he was talking to a guy about all the projects that they have in Dubai. You know, how they've made these massive buildings and created islands. Oh, yeah. They've got a world thing. They've got the tree palm tree thing. And, you know, it's like, how do you continually push the boundaries of what you're doing and developing in the country? And the guy said, two things. Just doing it for long enough. I'm throwing enough resources at it. Now, financial but also effort. Yeah. And you'll get there eventually. Just takes time and consistency. And it's true with everything, I think. You know, you can achieve most things if you dedicate enough effort and time. And so you've just got to head down and just keep putting one foot in front of the other until you get to where you're going. Yeah, I like that. And it's, I mean, I've still got a shitload of stuff to sort of. But I am at least getting through it. Yeah. I find out about CQC probably tomorrow or the day after I'm fucking dreading that. And that has been an absolute nightmare. The paperwork pile ended up being like this. CQC. Yeah, CQC commission. OK. OK. The paperwork ended up doing like this. And for a lot of nonsensical crap that didn't make any sense to me, but just in case of right, there's no point arguing this. Just do it. Yeah. And, and you know, sometimes you just got to, I think we spend so much time panicking about the problem or emotionally reacting to the problem. We waste time that could actually be done with dealing with the problem. Yeah. I think it's a bad thing. I think you've just got to try and step out of the box and look at it from a, you know, a practical application, right? What can I do to fix this, help this improve this? And if not, what's coming up that's going to add to this, that's going to make it worse? And how can I offset that? You know, and I, I mean, I just overstretch. So it was very much case of right. I need to start right. What can I offset? What can I give someone else to do? What can I just get rid of? Yeah. Even if it means ignoring this other stuff for a couple of days, can I just get rid of that for two days? Focus on this, get it done, and then that's one less problem to go with moving forward. And I did, I had to put a couple of projects on complete hold and go, right, this just has to go on about Bernhard Fenerne to, I've got this dealt with. Yeah, yeah, it's very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, and it's, I don't think that's anything we haven't covered before in one way or another. But you said it in a different way today. And I can relate to that and I can agree. I give you an example that I wanted to build up our YouTube shorts, which we didn't have any YouTube shorts at one point. And so I was like, all right, we just start putting them out and I hired Payton to help start making shorts and I'm putting shorts out. And you know, there's a whole demographic of people that aren't listening to the full shows that might enjoy shorts. So let's try to build that out. And now, fast forward, a couple of years down the road or a year down the road of building shorts, if you click one of them, you can go to the page and there's a whole page of them. But it took just starting and just continued to crack at it. Go at it. Go at it a little at a time. Just chip away. And we've got the library of them now, you know. Just do it. I mean, I think this is true within training and everything. You'll never know what you're capable of until you try. The issue with a lot of people, issues probably the wrong word, where people fail or fall is that when the obstacles come and they will come, because if anything is worth having, it's going to give you obstacles that we feel overwhelmed by them. And I mean, I've delved into stuff. When we started looking at training school and NCO and NLCN approval, I didn't even understand what I was reading. It was like a different bloody language. But step by step, I've dug into it and gone a bit further and gone a bit further. And now two thirds of the way through my course, and I've had to pull that on the back burner because of the CQC. But it's like, and now it's a language I can communicate in. It's a terminology I can start to have a conversation in and start to understand. But what I first started, it was like, this just looks like frigging mandarin to me. It's a bloody clue. Yeah. But instead of looking at the whole chunk, I just bit off the first bit and then the second bit and then the third bit. And I think planning is, you don't have to have a formal plan, but I think having an approach. And half a time we spend this all this time, oh god, look at the problem. When in fact, if we actually break it down and go, well, I can do that. Yeah. And I can do that. And then the time you get to that, you start to realise, oh, actually, I could probably do that as well. And you learn to develop as you go through. Yeah, man. I couldn't agree more.

it same product and everyone should get on the gear everyone all the gear all the gear okay remember Big Ron industrial your codes save money avoid people Scott that's going on today what is the news the news is the Tampa Pro I mean I got to tell you that there are so many people that I've talked to over the weekend that were just so freaking pumped about this show I don't know about you guys did you guys hear about like there was a lot of energy around this contest we should yeah we should do it right in honor of even body building and break it down just like you right except for maybe skipping third place or four making attempts we randomly pick eight numbers to skip before we do show right yeah random number generator of people were gonna skip okay well first of all the Jordan Quentin showdown oh yes so obviously we haven't talked about Jordan on the show really but I've been watching him on Instagram he's like I knew he was gonna be really good but you know I just thought we'll see what happens in this lineup right yeah I initially like someone sent me I know we didn't talk about it on the show yet but someone sent me like a list of the names like a week ago and Lionel Bayek he was on that list right he yeah he of course didn't do the show I don't know what happened but Lionel was on the list and I just said oh well if Lionel's on the way Lionel can be he'll win right but that's all the attention I paid I didn't know what he'd been doing lately I haven't seen him in ages right yeah and of course he didn't do the show so we wound up with like I don't know who had this showdown picked Quentin and Jordan like who had that as like the top two I mean obviously they're both great but the lineup looked good I will say that I had Jordan as soon as he entered right because he's been working with Tuttle and what they have done in the last like Jordan was he's actually from like an hour from where I live right the changes he's made in the last two years are absurd he's he's up like 30 pounds and it's literally all dropped in the perfect places yeah I mean he he looks bigger than he is and he and he weighs I mean he was 270 something leading in and he looks every bit of it at his size you know so I sent to you guys the pictures and I was just like I just think he's too thick and obviously Quentin is bananas but crazy and he and Quentin wasn't on my radar at all on the other side of the spectrum no thought on him I immediately said I think what most people did outside of Jordan I was like well obviously got Jewett so there's a contender for the win and then you got Justin Shire and he's obviously a contender for the win as well and just looks so crazy too and like his progress picks and stuff is his dimensions are so insane you know so I was with you on that I was like I can't wait to see him so what I'm saying is I was a genius and also a complete moron that knows nothing about bodybuilding all the same time I I had I mean I saw Jordan was entered and you know Quentin you know I mean obviously Quentin stepped up and was like his all-time best this show and now it's like a new level of Quentin but you know we had a rough year last time he competed he wasn't as best at every show he redeemed himself in Toronto there a great deal but you know wasn't what he wanted so he just wasn't I wasn't like thinking oh he's gonna come in and stomp everybody I just said oh he's gonna be one of the guys probably top five first call out but I was looking at John Jewett and John Delarosa along with Jordan because you know we know John Delarosa has what it takes to always be in that top mix and pull out of when he's been to the Olympia before as no no surprise from to do it again and then John Jewett is just so complete and always on and you know he's such a smart guy that he knows how to actually improve his physique from outing to the next which is something that not everyone knows how to do or is capable of doing but John Jewett with the way he gathers data and pays attention to everything I almost expect him to find something to improve on every time he comes out and he looked he did look incredible and I was incredible so you know the only way John Jewett goes backwards with a look is if like his tan goes to shit or something like right yeah it's not it's not gonna be his management of variables that screws up John Jewett he's just too on that stuff that's his department right yeah so I knew those guys would all be in the top there but man that's Quentin look humongous like you realize that most bodybuilders are five foot eight like yeah that lineup and Quentin standing there opened up it's crazy how huge he is and I mean Quentin was just in my gym like you know a few months ago there he's like way over 300 pounds and super lean you know and it's just you for you see him in person and you're like oh cuz you know it's not there's not a lot of guys that are like the six foot plus huge right oh yeah you know and they're you know they're a different they're a different a different experience to encounter in person when you know yeah let me ask you guys this let me ask you guys this because I'm kind of getting off this show but I on that note with Quentin of course we're getting off it yeah you can come back come back with Quentin I feel right off there's one person that I could I could see like apples to apples being a comparison and that's Samson like I feel well you were but Andrew Jack in that in that combo yeah yeah yeah yeah in the Andrew Jack category yeah yeah what would it be crazy joints yeah what would it take you to be Samson two years two years just more more more more okay more when I when I look at him all I think and this is almost everybody will but but now that he's brought it in yeah just needs time if I was a top guy if I was beating him right now like a Jordan or these guys I'd be like oh shit well the like not like he's coming and he's going to get bigger and he obviously has figured out of dial it in right without flattening out I mean because that was the not great like he hit a tough time previously with I get the condition yeah getting the condition with I gap the I gap to buckle yeah but he was I mean and I know this gets over done Quentin can win any show there is eventually he isn't he is a guy who can win an oral class he's a guy who could win in Olympia I really I look at him and I mean and that I would not have said let's see 72 hours ago but now I look at him and and even how he even how he poses it something I pushed to my clients I'm sure you guys to too is when he was hitting his shots I feel like he's looking at the judges and the crowd and saying you're welcome I'm gonna I'm gonna you've been watching a lot of bodybuilding now let me show you another level I mean he is wildly impressive I'd love to have him on the show I think you know him well Ron so we should get in yeah no I'd love to get Quentin on I'm even I mentioned it to him before and it's cool with it so tell me no Scott he'll come I used the I know not all the time I don't mean I definitely would love to see Quentin doing Olympia man he he you know that would does he go into Texas this weekend yes he's gonna do an Olympia this year yeah oh yeah play this yeah he looks so good here I mean what the fuck so I see him when I think of him in his structure I'm thinking guys like while I mentioned Samson I'm thinking guys like Tony Freeman Cedric McMillan Sean Rodin you know he's got that type of structure to him yeah he's brought his backup to the knock was at his back wasn't fully there yet because he's so huge yeah I mean it's a lot of size a big huge guy needs like so much muscle hanging off his back it's like I don't see any thai gap there but it's the yeah I mean I don't think people realize either I know you can see in the video but standing in front of him he is literally as wide as a truck also too you don't get it because of how tall like his height and everything but when you see him in person his calves are like the size of my freaking head and like yeah obviously I've got that I've got that head I've got that calf thing because I like you know I always wanted crazy calves and never had him but I didn't even notice him so you see a guy like Quentin in shorts and you just like like just to get cantaloupes just massive you know you're thinking oh god this is so unfair no one else gets yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what we he has those so Ron and I don't yeah just unbelievable and I know no one cares about calves except for guys who don't have calves that's I feel like it should be illegal for guys with calves to wear full length pants even their weddings or shorts or make them and make them enjoy the fact that they have calves or don't let them enjoy the fact that they have calves I'm torn I have a great story about that I was helping a guy with his posing one day and we're just we're trying to adjust his legs so that they would like pop you know and how should I stand and I said you got to stand the way that makes your legs look best and he goes well my legs look best in pants and I was like I can't do that but yeah there you go so I wanted to bring up third place did we do the top two we did we did so far over oh my god I'm throwing a roll here this I don't even know how to say names Joseph Palacios is that right I don't know California dude yeah I didn't ask I I'd never even heard of him yeah and I mean I don't know if Gilco's got a video of him there's Scott but if he does pull him up I mean yeah I think this is the guy too that we had an old picture of him I guess Andrew pulled some stuff together on the last BSG and everybody said that was the worst picture you could have shared and skip tore him up on the podcast he was like this guy's not gonna do well everybody everybody that's the everybody who is up on the comments for that he looks really good look at how I love is he doesn't have the greatest shape genetically right yeah but he's so massive yeah he really is and you and and you know ignore him and also to another lesson I mean I know this approach so it's different from you know most people watching the show are doing like you know local regional state national level shows but you know the glutes shredded glutes oh yeah like get your conditioning down you know I heard a guy at the gym the other day talking about posing and he was like yeah but you know my posing is really good and you know I've got better shape so you know blah blah blah and he was talking he was kind of speaking I was over I was he was dropping yeah he was trying to talk around that he wasn't shredded right okay and obviously that's what you do yeah yeah yeah a lot of size yeah like look at the glutes you know you can say oh he doesn't have the best structure yeah look at his posing too though like he's he's doing a posing phenomenal posing right now the side chest is crazy look at the size of the pecs yeah absurd really good control you know really good control of everything he's doing here in these shots yeah yeah I think a lot of people were rooting for him too based off of the feedback we got on blood sweat and gear on Friday because there was an outpouring of people are like you guys did Joe dirty really after you guys sucked so bad yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah look not incredible and then obviously like we're touched we had a Jewett and fourth I saw nothing off it he just ran into a lineup yeah you know and I think that's a thing good for the for the viewers to the compete like That's why you can't base all of your success on where you place. Because I saw nothing when I was looking at Joe, I was like, oh, if he would have done X, he would have moved up. I'm like, not in that lineup. He could have been fourth or third in my eyes, but I mean, outside of that, there was nowhere to go. Yeah. Yeah. And then I wanted to, I don't know Bruno Santos, but he was also obviously awesome, very condition, huge legs and adductors. I don't know if you guys saw his pictures, but in the front double when your adductors grabbed my eyes, that's pretty freaky. I got some video of him. Yeah. Here we go. I can't remember which guy. Oh, yeah, yeah. Is this a guy? Yeah. Yeah. Real crispy. I feel like they did a good job with the lighting at this show too. Yeah. Well, Gilco does a great job of getting the footage up quickly. Also like all day, I just watch this page. I was like, oh, this will be out of watch. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, he looks good. And if he was just a little harder, he's a threat to go up even further. You know, him and Dela Rosa were pretty, were kind of like, yeah, like fourth and fifth there. And Dela Rosa got six, but I wanted to mention, because I don't know if you guys knew, but you know, he's done 34 pro shows. I believe it. Yeah, I totally believe that. I would have fifth place at a New York Pro in 2012. Okay. Yeah. Proud to say I competed with John once. Did you really? Yeah. He did the Van Pro the year I did. He got second to Fuad. It was him and Fuad for like first and second. Yeah. He's been at this like, I remember him training with Victor Martinez when Victor was on top. You know what I mean when he was doing great winner. Winner had to buy Denny's at midnight after the show for everybody. John is one of the biggest people. When you see him in person, he's like the small, like his height stature. But he is enormous. Yeah. Just absolutely huge. I love that he, you know, he went out with a phenomenal look. Yeah, he sure did. Last year he, bodybuilding didn't retire him. He retired. And I think that not a lot of people get to say that in a 13 year pro career. Yeah. You know, he looked pretty great last year too. Like his conditioning has been on point. But he was just definitely an old school guy in the fact that like, he competed. Yeah, I just went back and looked while we were starting the show. And I was like, I'm counting them up. And I'm like, holy shit. I think, you know, from my count, which could have been off by one or two, since I was speeding. I had 34 pro shows and he was always in the mix. Yeah. Yeah. And he did a few Olympians too, Denny. Like at least, at least a couple. Oh, yeah. No, he's got, let's see here. One, two. It's a good shot. Nice. Most muscular. Let's see, two Olympias. Yep. And then the big ones, he has, including the other, the South Africa and stuff. He's got one, two, three, four, five, five, six, seven, seven Olympias. Arbitoles. Arnels. Yeah. And I believe three of those were the two or three were the US version. Okay. Right. And I mean, and he always brought it there too. How many pro shows did he win? Fourth at the Arnold Classic in 24 in Columbus. Yeah. Okay. So he said he was, he must have won at least five. Yeah. They're not listed off. I have to touch every single one, but I mean, yeah, he was, he was winning shows. He's literally always in the mix. I mean, I've just randomly touched and I've already hit three wins. Yeah. So, you know, and so he is retired. No. Yeah. He retired right after the show. Yeah. Yeah. He's a hell of a hell of a show. Oh, he's giving hell of a career. We could have John on. He'd have fun stories. Oh, yeah. He loved you. Yeah. Yeah. He'd be great. And he won, he did win in New York Pro one or two of those two. Oh, did he? So, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He won the 2014. I know that. Okay. Yeah. That's a big win. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, he had an off show in 2016. Yeah. And then I look at who beat him and you're like Dexter Jackson. Oh, there you go. Yeah. Victor Martinez. I'm like, oh, okay. Yeah. It's a thing. Like I said, I remember seeing videos of him and Victor training together. And that was like in the days of Kai being back in New York and competing. Yeah. He's been a New York long time. I call that that New York era. Oh, yeah. Yeah. There was that last blast of like. Yeah. I remember really like Juan Morel and yeah, that yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Kevin English and Juan Morel training at Bebs. I trained with both of them at Bebs. Did you really? Yeah. Kevin and Juan together. Kevin English. Incredibly strong. When you trained with him? Yeah. They did so much volume. Okay. Yeah. They were just doing, I just remember thinking like that one bench is like Juan Morel. How many sets did we do? That was like the most volume I ever did for Chester my whole life. Yeah. I did a chess workout with Kevin English and Juan Morel and I think we did 30 sets of chess. Okay. And just 26 more than me. Yeah. And he's done. He's done. Does he stay home by then? Yeah. And like literally third or fourth exercise was like a superset with flat bench. Okay. Like and one was doing three plates. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm like, oh, that's not manageable. Like, just many sets in doing like a superset with crossovers and he's doing three, 15, boom, boom, boom. And then like, like he was strong. Like they move. You know that sort of like volume strength where you're not. Yeah. You crazy weights, but you look at the poundages you're using like 20 sets in. Yeah. And you're like, oh, that's. Yeah. You just go all day. That adds up. Yeah, that's up. It was good. And I remember we were like 30 sets into chess and Juan's one gets a phone call. And he's like, I got to go my truck's done. He like leaves. I'm like, oh, well, we've done a lot of sets. I guess he's done. Like, you guys didn't know is when you started that workout, they started building that truck. Yeah, he was getting it detailed. There's something he was like getting it detailed. Yeah. We were like training and we're like, and then so me and Kevin did like one more thing afterwards before we were done. It was funny. We're feeling. I remember back then when a King Williams was like the new kid. Do you remember that when he came in? Oh, wow. And he was just like the crazy strong new kid. Hey, you know who else old, we're talking about old school guys who've been around for a while. You know who I talked to over the weekend was Derek Farnsworth. Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah. He's traveling today as we record this to the master's Olympia. So he's like, I think I still have his thumb somewhere jammed into my low back. Yeah. Yeah. So we're going to get him on by the way, when he got we have to have him on again and stuff. I say Derek worked on me once, but it was sort of an impromptu went in the back of the booth. I mentioned something about my problem, lat and he's like, oh, come with me. And I could go in the back of the mutant booth and he just starts ramming his thumb into my ribs and he's up under my armpit and he's like under my shoulder blade. And I'm like screaming. Yeah. And he's like, yeah, something in there. And he's like, you know, pulling my lat off my ribs and I'm going on at the mutant booth. You know, I'm like, yeah. Well bruised up. So he's got some work he didn't get in some work on my on my shoulder, like in the front of the booth one time. I was like, that's clicking. He goes, here, give me your arm. Yeah. And like five minutes later, I was like, Derek, remove your limb. Yeah. I was like, thanks buddy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was it was just a great show all the way around and there haven't been a lot of shows when I'm not there to be honest that I'm watching them throughout the day. Yeah. So you realize we made it from first to sixth and we didn't miss anybody. I think that even bodybuilding was rubbing off on us. You know, this is what it was. You know, you guys wanted to step up your game a little bit. Some. If he watches, he'll still tell us what we did wrong. But that's okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We didn't say enough negative stuff. You know what I mean? We needed to, you guys aren't color. Yeah. Yeah. Values. We like everybody. We like everybody. It was a good show. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Are we moving on? Yes. Yes. If we go any further, we'll start messing up. Oh yeah. Yeah. Right. It's like I've said two nice things to my wife. I'm just going to leave it. Yeah. Right. I'm not going to try to come up with a third nice thing. No. I saw this amazing thing. The other day, you guys, it was on Instagram and this guy walks into his house and he looks at his wife. He goes, Hey, give me a beer real quick before it starts. And she goes, okay. So she goes and gives him a beer. He drinks it and he sits on the couch. He goes, quick, quick. Grab me another beer before it starts. So she goes off and grabs the beer. He's back to him. He drinks it. He's like, give me one more beer before it starts. She's like, before what starts? He goes, just give me the beer. Hurry. So she, he gets the beer. He starts to drink it and she goes, are you just going to sit here all the he goes, shit. Now it started. I lost it. I'm like, Oh, that's what he was talking about. I'm like, ah, fuck it started. Here we go. Yes. Okay. Good stuff. All right. We got some questions. We got a bunch of questions, man. Not a lot of them. My people never fail. You know, on my short notice, oh shit, we didn't plan anything. Help me. Yeah. All right. We got to talk about your death threat. Oh, we should cover my death threat. Am I allowed to read the death threat? So I realized I have done, I've done nothing, I've done nothing impactful with my entire life. I have affected nobody. I have. Let's not call it that anymore, by the way. Let's just stop using that word on a life threat. Maybe on a life. I'll cut on a life threat. Unfriendly email. Yes. I realize now I have not tried hard enough to make an impact because I'm not getting on a live emails. Like yeah, yeah, you must be doing something great to have someone hate you so much. I like the way you're looking at this. Like I need to try harder because I feel like a little left out. Like I've got people that dislike me. I've got people that say I hate that guy. Blah blah blah. I've heard lots of insults about me and I've gotten some mean messages, but I've never gotten in your life and your family. And your family, my whole family. Yeah. I want my family included. And here's the thing. If I were to receive that, I would hope that I knew what I had done. Do you know what I mean? Oh, he's re-thing that because of this thing that I said. I don't even know what. We don't even know what Dusty said. Because I want a chance to change Scott. Or just think responsibility. I thought the title of the email was the best. Dusty Hansha, son of a bitch posting some crappy contents. I love how he left spaces. What was the word between the letters? So I assume this S O space N. Yeah. Bitch was B space I space T space C H. They stayed together. Yeah. So then the death threat itself kind of has some spaces in it. On a life. Yeah. On a life. Yeah. On a life threat. Are they sort of thinking that that'll dodge like a sensor bot? Or I don't. I'm wondering that AI that picks up violent threats or something. I was almost like the spaces are. I wonder if I did. It had been reported in some way would. Right. Like some email filter. Yeah. Something picks it up and reports a suspicious content if it's not spaced out like that. Right. But in a positive note, guys, the last line was rest in peace. Oh, that's nice. I feel like he like brought it up noticely at the end of the day. It's all going to be okay. We all do have to go on a live. Yeah. Which is going to be a lot of space. Well, all of us one day will be there. You know, so I brought it up and read it to Nikki and she just laughed and kept making lunch. It was amazing. Yeah. I enjoyed it. Well, see, I'd be tempted to, since you're living the states, I'd be tempted to like give it to like someone in the FBI. And you find out who this is. I give it to them. Then they're like, it was us. It's part of the psi op we've started against you to drive you insane. Right. Then they found out I'm already there because I laughed and then went to my next set. Yeah. Yeah. So Dusty's getting emails. So if anyone out there hates me, step it up. I want, I feel like Dusty has had, you know, like people that they say if you don't have any enemies, you've never done anything impactful. Yeah. I was listening to this right. I'm starting to feel like my life has been too soft and nice. I don't have these emails coming in. I wonder if I have enough impact. Yeah. We'll get you there, buddy. You know, we're just sprinkling a little more American on you. You'll get there. I need more of that. Okay. Beautiful. What's next? I mean, how do you leave that topic? That wasn't even on the questions. We haven't answered the questions yet. That was an answer. That was an answer. Everybody the update. Yeah. Scott, do you thing? Whatever you like. All right. I'm just going to go from the top there. And I do see one, two. We'll have to get to one from my client. We have a story from the weekend. But before we do, from dude man with a bunch of O's, what is the last cycle by Ron and Dusty before going to TRT? Scott, I know that you're on the gas. If how is that going currently? I don't know if I'd say I'm on the gas. I love the show. Thanks for the entertainment. But yeah. What was, if you guys remember, what was your last cycle? My last cycle. Well, I mean, I did the van Pro in 2015. And then, and then I was off season 2016 trying to get, you know, nice and juicy big again when I'm in my quad. Oh. And I remember I was 315 at the time when I took my quad tour. And I was running, I remember I was running test in EQ and GH. So it was this test EQ in GH at the time and I was 315 and that's when I tore my quad. And then after that, you know, and during the rehab part, I just used like a bit of test for like the year to rehab, you know. And then I think I did like another probably cycle of EQ with test again to like try to size up or, you know, something and then that would have been my last cycle. And then I would have been like, okay, enough's enough. And I would have been like, let's open the gym. Yeah, there we go. Yeah. So it would have been test and test EQ and GH. I bet money was probably the last cycle I ran probably somewhere around 750 test and like 500 EQ or something like just basic shit. I would have been doing a show. Mine would have been after, I was probably training for about two months after the coma. Yeah. And I was like, let's speed this process up a little bit. And so I just went with real simple. I did 750 test, 300 EQ and then I dropped some A-bombs in there for about four weeks. And then I got real heavy real quick and I was like, oh, better get rid of those. That was always my tried and true. And I know Ron is with me on that. Like, test and EQ was just went in doubt, drop those in and have a good time. And I never really got fancy with the cycles even when I was growing. I was like, yeah, thought those two things in, things take place. And we talked about this on the show before, but I got to like say this again for people. I have been up, like I'd win as high as 1200 on test. I just didn't really see any change. I didn't, you see enough difference between the 750 line and the 1200 that it made sense. So I just didn't do it. It wasn't like an anti or, oh no, I'm walking the path. So I'm going to go lower. I went up and nothing happened. And I was like, well, then what's the point? I know, I know what boosting, you know, obviously other things went up as well. But I was like, there were just a point for me where it was very obvious that the, the return on investment wasn't there. And I like to just put that out there because everyone thinks that I'm like holding some flag for all low doses. It's like, no, just the doses that work. Yeah. Like, you know, in my, in my prime of like chasing to be as big as I could, if I needed 1500 milligrams of test to do, I would have done it. Yeah. It's not like I'm like, oh, I would never. It just wasn't necessary. And when I tried to go up to a higher level, it just wasn't, it didn't really, I didn't see anything. So, and I've dabbled with here and there since then, but it's more like, you know, for fun. I'm like, oh, what would it be to throw in 400 milligrams of primo with my test here and see what happens? You know, yeah. I remember you saying you did that. It was a while ago. I, I, I came, and it was like not, and that's kind of, I hate saying what I've done now because I usually don't really stick with it to be completely honest with you. I'm not like running cycles like I was in about maybe two, three months ago, I decided I was like, I'm going to get back on a cycle and I'm going to do like a legit cycle, like 750 tests, something like, I can't remember what it was if it was like 800 tests and 700 EQ or something. And it lasted about two weeks. I was like, I think it's a shot. Yeah. I was like, I don't want to do all these shots. And I don't want to have five months of gear. So I was like, you know what? How about I do? It was like eight, we'll say it was like 800 and 600. I was like, well, then how about it's 400 and 300? And I was like, well, about just 300 tests and no EQ. And I was like, well, it just, yeah. Yeah. But that said, I do have some DHB on hand. I have some clients that all kind of around the same time wanted to start DHB. And I had heard, so I had run DHB dihydro bulldenon basically as testosterone breaks down into DHT, aqua poise breaks down into DHB, right? The reduced form. So I, you know, I'd heard, I'd used it twice. I'd used it once in a cut situation and once in an off situation. I had a great experience with it. And lately I had been hearing people say in the last year or so well, it's really a toxic compound. And I had heard this kind of pirated on comments where I'd be like, God, you see, you know, liver value is going to go through the roof. So I have a client who you see, Suma has been up to runs gym actually. He said, great guy. He's a cool dude. And he's competing again this weekend. Yeah, he's, he is like literally men's, right? Yeah, he's unmen say, yeah, he's a man's a guy. And he works with me. God, sorry for outing it. Yeah. So he's like, I don't want to make it. It's not. I don't want to use trend this off season or this contest prep. I just don't want to. You know, I get a little edgy. It messes my sleep a little. What else could we do? And we talked about the HP. So he starts running six weeks in. We did labs. His labs are the best they've ever been on a cycle. Like he's doing incredible. Somebody else that I've worked with is getting labs done this week. And I've got some. And just because I don't want to run a bunch of gear, I'm going to do 100 tests. And 100 DHB twice a week. That's going to be my cycle. And I can handle that because that's literally like a CC and a half per week. So I'm going to do that for a little while. We'll see how that goes. It's very low dose. You know, nice. Okay. I'll get to. And then we've got some other people that are getting labs because I want to put this to rest once and for all how toxic is dihydribulmonary. You know what is hard for me with toxicity is that it's not one size fits all. Yeah. Like I've done my blood work like after a show and I'm like, Oh God, I don't want to see this. Yeah. And then it comes through and I'm stunned at how good it is. I'm like slightly out of range on a couple of things and you're like, how is that possible? Yeah. And then I've clients that have run a couple of things. They send me their blood work. And I'm like, Oh my God. You need to be a dime. Yeah. Yeah. My, my worst blood work ever was one of my very first shows. Okay. And then within five weeks, six weeks of the show, it was completely corrected. And it couldn't have been gear related because I was on very little gear. It had to have been the way I died it. And so what happened was I had done a couple shows already. And then for the 99 Alberta's, which I was peeled at and won the overall, I was very broke. I was going to college full time. I had no money. So I just bought like 20 amps, a sustenance and a bottle of clean like in a cost of membership and a cost of membership. I literally did that show on two amps, a sust a week. And then my buddy gave me like a handful of halo tabs for like two weeks. Like I had nothing. Like it was very minimal drugs. And then after the show and my blood work done, everything was pretty good. But my liver value, my ALT was a thousand. Okay. Yes. Hi. Time to take a break for your halo. And I was like, that's, I took like 20 makes a halo a day for two weeks and 500 makes a test. I can't never see that before because my show before that I took like other stuff and my liver and I was fine. But the diet I'd done, I had done this diet where, and this is why I think my liver value was artificially elevated. I was dieting on very high protein, almost no carbs. Okay. And so, you know, your body, your body does a lot to change protein into glucose. And I think I had a lot of liver stress on all the processes that may have been going on with the diet I was doing because it was extremely low carb high protein. I was kind of living on protein. And then as soon as I went, like my doctor was like, oh my god, do you liver? And then within like five, six weeks, it was back down to range and I was like, oh, and then I never, ever saw an elevated liver value even, even, even over a hundred after that. Really? And a drawl and other stuff. But I never did that severe long term of a kind of almost carbless diet. So are you saying that rice fixes liver levels? Yes. No, I'm just saying that's a good way to suspect is that the diet, the forcing the liver to process all the protein into fuel. Yeah. Probably had some to do with that liver enzyme level. I'm guessing. With 20 milligrams of halo for two weeks, that's like nothing. Yeah. So that doesn't math out. Yeah, never ever again saw anything like that ever. And I was just like so weird. And I was young and I was only 23. So like you're so fresh and resilient. Yeah. Like it had to have been some weird freaky thing with protein, gluconogenesis. Gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis. Yeah, gluconeogenesis. Yeah, whatever you stress though. Gluconeogenesis. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's my guess. I don't know. I'm not an expert. But I was like to mentally think of how someone could twist what was just said. You got a rice bro. What you got was don't go low carbs. Got it. No, it's just some funny circumstances. It was something going on. Yeah. Got that makes sense. Okay. We got two questions here from the shredded cheese who's a client of mine competed this week. I got to tell you guys a story about him too. By the way, but I'm going to throw these questions at your first says you could only eat protein bars for the rest of your life or go vegetarian or would you rather eat soup or sandwiches for the rest of your life and go around. So there are two separate questions. Two separate questions. Yeah. So I couldn't live on protein bars for the rest of my life. I couldn't do it. If I go and vegetarian, that's tough. Fuck. That's tough one. That's tough one. Because if you go vegetarian, you can't have milk chocolate again for the rest of your life. So there's the protein bars. I don't know man. Protein bars like after I eat like three of them. I'm like, can I get one? Couldn't you be like one of those soft veg people where they're not like fully vegan so maybe the chocolate could stay. They have soft gas like religion, you know, where you have the rules you follow and the ones you don't. Well there's vegan and there's vegetarian and there is a difference. But like vegans, well a true vegan, like people forget what that means. But like back in the old days, a vegan wouldn't even wear leather shoes. Yeah. Right. Like that's a true vegan, right? People forget that. They think it's just diet related. But this is vegetarian, right? Yeah. Yeah. I think we can keep the chocolate. I don't know man. I don't know. I don't really care too much about vegetarian foods. I would definitely go and get myself a lot eating the protein bars though. That's what I was going to say. In defense of those around me. Yeah. I'd go vegetarian. I'd have to live on like chocolate flavored vegetarian protein powder and can we time travel in this because if we can go back and make it yummy to like the early 2000s when all the protein bars were full of shit. They were just candy bars. Oh, they were good. I can live off of the detour bars. Oh, I can live off of detour bars. I can live off detours. They're with the one exception. So if I can go back to like oh one time, I'm going protein bars. What happened to detour? Does it still exist? No, I think once they had to meet label claims, it didn't quite taste the same. Yeah. I remember the first time I tried one of those, this is how it goes down when you're a young body. I think this is a snake. You take a bite and you go. This is definitely not actually on the label. And then you continue to eat them as if the label is accurate or you have three at your first time that detour has come out, you eat three at a show and then you almost shit your pants at the show. Yeah. Yeah. That was my morning every day when I was a kid. I would go in and get a detour bar when I get to work and then a fedra drink. Oh god. And kick the day off with pure fedra and candy. The stuff we did to our systems. I was recently explaining to somebody about Yo Himbine and I was like, well, if you took any fat burners in the early 2000s, you probably had used. And as I was telling him that my brain went back to like, do you remember how popular every company's fat burner was? There was like red line in LIFO 6. Everybody had a fat burner. You know, all of those things, man. Hydrocots. And you know all that. Oh yeah. Well, that was a great thing. That was a great thing. Yeah. I'm going to say I'm going to plug my friend Bill Toco's protein bar, the war on sugar. He sent me a couple boxes of these and I'm going to tell you they are actually really good and they have pure weight, isolate in them. They do have a lot of fiber. So that's kind of like the way they get away because it's like a keto bar. So I don't know if I could eat like six of them a day. But I have eaten two and my digestive system was cleaned out in a good way. It wasn't a bad thing, but I was like, yeah. Yeah, I think I'm down to two. Two is the number. I had a barbeque once. I was had a barbeque once and I had a burger. Well, I had a few burgers and I had like a third burger. And I was like, oh, that one was pretty good. And I just had my burgers plain, you know me, right? I just have like a patty and maybe a slice of cheese. And anyways. And then someone's like, oh, you ate one of the veggie patties. It was one of the black bean burgers and I was like, oh, that's why it tasted different. But it was pretty yummy. Those are good. Yeah. But then someone at the party told me, oh, those aren't the good quality ones. And I was like, oh, well, I liked them. Was it better than that? Yeah. I think I can live on nose. Maybe I can live on nose. Maybe I need the shitty quality. Yeah. That way it was good, you know what I mean? That's classic. Now we already know Ron's answer on the soup for Sam. Super Sam. So what are the things that I'm going to do with the soup and beef and barley soup? Yeah. Get your protein in there with the beef. I'm going to be checking. I'm almost an old man now. I can order soup. Yeah. Don't see what's in there. Don't see what's in there. Don't see what's in there. Don't see what's in there. I'm going to be checking. Yeah. Don't threaten me with a sandwich because that's not a threat. No. I just say which is every day. I'd love off sandwiches too. Yeah. Done. Can I make it myself or do someone else have to touch it? I prefer if someone else touches it. Which is with mail. Every sandwich has mail. The sandwich, the problem is the sandwich comes and I don't trust exactly what's been done to it. I want to put the gloves on. Peel the top back and look someone's spittin' this. I know. So I have a story. A lot of layers there. From this client. And I have questions, a follow up question for you guys. So this is Jeremy, the shredded cheese. And here's the deal. So he had to die away. Yeah. So here's the deal. He had to die it really hard. And he's at a point where he struggled to make weight. So his cutoff was 194. And we're eating next to nothing. Food's real low. And he's at 195, 197. And his weight just doesn't want to come down. So we went to basically a modified keto diet. And we got him down to like, we're solid, 191, 192, 193 area. But he would also have trouble with sleep from the diet. So if he didn't sleep well, he'd wake up at like 197 or 202. And if he woke up at 202 the day, so we have to weigh in Friday night because it's a state level show that he just did this past weekend. And so we ended up having to basically starve him that day. No food that day fast. And we had to control fluid. Like, okay, you're good. You know, he'd weigh in. And I'm like, okay, you can drink four ounces of water over the next 30 minutes. And then four ounces of water after that. And then check back in again. And we'll see if you can have more water or if you have to wait, you know, right? So he has to drive. I think it was like two hours. And that he's driving on Fridays, timing it up so that he can get there right at five o'clock when we in start, right? Everything is timed up perfectly about two hours. And it's my date day. So I'm not doing anything else for work except for hanging out with my wife. And then talking to him. And I didn't hurt from him for a while. And I kind of texted him, see what's going on? Everything's good. And then I don't hear from him for a while longer. He should be showing up pretty soon. And then I get the text, I forgot my trunks. Oh my God. He's been, I tell you about the diet, right? He was pretty upset at this point. You know what I'm saying? Like I think he can probably hopefully laugh at it now. It was like, you know what, man, I've just been so hungry for so long. My sleep for con sucks. And like now this, it's like, I don't need this. Like I just, I want this to be done. I want it to be over, you know? And I feel for him, but at the same time, I'm like, but he looks, but I think we got a pretty good plan here. You know, I know what we're going to do with him after we get, after we get some of the scale, we just have to get through this thing. And but he got very reactive. And I've been there, you know what I'm saying? So moral, the story is he ends up going all the way home to our trip turns into like a five hour drive, I feel for the dude, not drinking, not eating, right? And he makes way and he ends up winning two classes. Like he, in his mind was blown, right? He gets up there for the overall and bodybuilding. And the guy who won the overall would like just completely destroyed anybody in any thing level show is big dude. He looked really good. So there's no love loss there. You know what I mean? He did the best he could, did incredible. And his perspective completely changed too, you know? And he's like, oh shit. So I guess my point is, because you guys know firsthand, like you make a mistake like that and you let it get in your head, that could be the end of your prep. Do you know what I mean? Like one bad thing can happen and you're like, oh, this is it. Like I don't care anymore. I'm done. I just want to go home and eat. You kind of, you tap out like that. It all worked out for him and I'm glad that it did. And I think there was huge lessons for him. But like, I think that it's a great learning. It's a great teaching tool around. And I thought we could talk about either mistakes that we've made that felt like the end of the world right before the show or maybe a mistakes we've seen clients make and how did we pull through those things? Because it, am I right? It could have gone the opposite way. Had he said like screw it, I'm just going to drink water. And we're going to do whatever happens. Like he wouldn't have made weight. You know what I mean? Yep. Or just stress. Yeah. Yeah. Um, fuck. I've seen everything go wrong. Like, and some of it obviously the self-savitage part. I had a guy. He was doing light heavy weights and he was like very good. Was it a provincial level show? He'd already done one show and won the overall or whatever. So like he was good. He was threat to win this show. And he was getting ready for the light heavy weights. And I remember he couldn't get a hold of him on Wednesday. He'd think it was. And then on Thursday he's like, hey, I'm not going to do the show. What? He's like, what? And he's like, I went to Burger King yesterday. And I ate like you don't even want to know. I just fuck went off. And I'm like, well, what do you weigh? And he's like, two, 12 or something. And I'm like, oh, dang. And he's a light heavy. So what? 99 is just cut off. 10 pounds over, but like Burger King puffy. Yeah. I'm like, oh, God. So like he's, I have a talk with him about finishing. I have this big talk where I pull all the energy out of my ass to try to like motivate this guy. I'm like, I know how to fix this. Yeah. I don't know if you'll be your very best, but you will be very good as long as you're a light heavy. As long as you weigh 197, you should look really good. Yeah. Right. Like, help me help you fix this. You're going to regret this if you don't know the money. I forced him to like agree to do the show. Yeah. There's two days Thursday Friday. Just give me two days. Yeah. So I was like, hey, eat this. Go pound this. Drink this. Just go hard. His weight. And you know, sometimes when you, if someone eats like that, their weight doesn't peak until like 36 hours later. Yes. I remember, I remember he woke up on the Friday. I remember him being a little heavier than the day. Like, do you know what I mean? Like it was like he'd gone on the no carbs and stuff, but it was still just so many calories in his body like, you know? And so then Friday was just like pulling water off of him. I remember he went to weigh in and he weighed in at like 201. They gave him an hour. I think like, you gotta come back in an hour because we gotta hide in everyone. Bub, bub, bub, bub, you have an hour. And I remember I made him take a suppository. Yep. I was like, you are going to put this up your ass. That's what happens in body building. Like, you are going to go to your room. Now, and you are going to do this. Like, and then I made him run the stairs in his sweatsuit. Yep. I'm like, just go up and down as many times you can. Like, don't stop. And like, he came back soaking wet. He went and like, got out. Good. And he made the weight. Yes, he did. Good. He won the show. He won the show. And then he quit body building completely. Hahaha. And I've ever afterwards, I was like, oh, god. It's so taxing to drag someone to a show like that and make them do it. And I swore I would never do it again. Yeah. Because someone's, and then I did, I've done it for a moment. Since then. We've all done it, boy, there was. You were as perspective. You know what I mean? Like, yeah, you want something more than they do. Like, you want it. Not only that, I mean, the athlete, like, they lose, you can. And I've had it happen to myself to degrees where like, you lose perspective. Ron, do you remember that movie? A momentum. Yes. So I've told people this movie, by the way, here's the analogy I use. I say there's a movie about this guy who'd wake up every day and he would forget all of his life every morning. He'd woke up so he started writing these Post-it notes to himself. And I'll tell him like a month out when they're doing good or six weeks out or at the beginning of the prep, I need you to write a Post-it note to yourself right now, mentally, about where you're at right now. Write your goals or what you want to achieve because you might need to look at that one day, you know, eight weeks or six weeks down the road, you know? Yeah. Yeah, it's funny because it's all in how you handle those things. In 2010, my first USA's, I don't, as you guys know, I don't book anything. I don't book travel. I didn't know how I'm going half the time. Literally, I'm going out of town this weekend. I found out the other day where we were going. I was like, oh, cool. I knew we were going to a cabin. I didn't even state it was in. Nice. But anyways, so Evian had booked where we were staying for the USA's and we're in the room. We're all set. We get there Wednesday, show Saturday and Thursday. I'm in my room and I get a call from the front desk and they're like, hey, you didn't check out. And I was like, yeah, I'm staying till Monday. And they're like, no, you're booked for one night. I was like, oh, no. I'm booked for the whole time. Well, we find out that she had bought, she had bought the room from a different site where essentially what they would do is book you. And then if there were openings, they would just book again every day. Well, the hotel apparently had sold out. And obviously that's a good time for a meltdown of some sort. And instead I looked at her and I said, here's my credit card, figure it out. And then I just sat down and I said, just let me know what's happening when it's all done. And I actually to this day have no idea what happened. I don't know if she paid them no idea. I just know I didn't switch rooms and everything went fine with the show. But I was like, yeah, that's on you, kiddo, figure it out. And here's the card that'll take care of the damage if it's needed. And that's it. But the worst thing I had with a client, not the one of the worst, was I had a guy coming in for a show. It was a big show. I think it was Emerald Cup. And I had him completely peeled. And he was suffering. And everything's going good. He flies up. I get my pictures the next day. We are dead nuts on. He's going well. Then I get my afternoon picks and they're a little off. Okay. And I was like, what'd you do today? And he's like, no, everything's good. Everything's good. And I was like, are you sure? Like nothing changed? And he's like, no, no, everything's good. Just, I don't know. I'm holding a little water out. It's okay. Well, get a good night's sleep then. Go to bed early. I think you may be stressed. Yeah. You know, I was like, I need you to relax. I'm like, no change the plan. But I went to go to bed early, take a sleep, made whatever. So he says, okay. The next morning he sends pictures and they're worse. Oh. And I said, bro, something's off. There's something you're not telling me. And he's like, can I call you? I was like, all right, so he called you. So you knew there's something up when he said, can I call you? Here's the thing. My mom brought these chocolates for me to eat after the show. Aaaaaah. And I was like, and how many did you consume before the show? And he said, all of them. And I'm like, oh, we've introduced dairy into the equation. Shit. A lot. You know what I'm like? I said, okay, just for my own knowledge, how much? And he said, whatever you think, it's more than that. Okay. Okay. And we did the best we could. He ended up getting third in the show. He would have won the overall four. Yeah. And I bring it up because I don't, I can't fathom doing that. Like, and he said, he said, I'll be honest with him. He goes, I just was, I wanted to have won. Yeah. And then he said, basically every time he went through the kitchen, he had another one. It's just one, you know, and then it fell apart. And I was just, I mean, that's a case like where, I mean, I was actually angry. Yeah. Because I'm like, dude, I don't give a shit. How you could eat three times that much. Saturday night, we just did a 24 week prep of hell. And you broke on chocolates 48 hours out. Oh, it just, and I struggle with understanding people in general. So this one really killed me. I mean, he killed himself. Okay. Ruin away on chocolates. Yeah. Yeah. I can't see you as that word. I keep saying, I know, I know. I was like between everything we've said today. I'm like, this one's not, this one's gotta be, yeah. 11 views. Yeah. Right. Why? I was good show. It's a lot of beeping going up and posts today. Yeah. That's funny. So yeah, that was a rough one. Oh, yeah. Lessons learned, right? No. Yeah. And I, you know, and Jeremy did a fantastic job, though too. So, and I think like I said, he woke up that next day, you know, the day of the show and he was like, all right, I'm focused to get it. But we all have those little moments. And it's just get through that. And sometimes, man, it's, it's, you know what, things just don't always go perfect. There's flights that get missed. There's, you know, trunks that get forgotten. And like we just, we just work with it. Because at the end of the day, nobody cares, right? When you get up on stage, nobody knows any of those stories. You just see your physique and it's not going to ruin you, you know, as long as you don't lose your head over it. I was going to say one thing real quick while we're on that subject. Guys, know that your brain dead at the end of the show and know there's a lot going on. Yeah. So a list of the things that you must bring should be put together like a week out. Yeah. So that you have all that stuff and then you check that list. And if you're flying, the things that you need to compete must go on the airplane with you. Yeah. Must, you know, trunks, you know, your CV with your posing music on it. They won't know. Yeah. Anything I remember we used to do that too. But I mean, all of that stuff has to go on the plane with you. I mean, I tell all the girls I work with, I'm like your shoes on the plane. Yeah. Your suit on the plane. Like do not. I don't, you know, your food that we must have on the plane the rest of your clothes. I don't care if you wear that suit all week. Right. Right. To the grocery store. I'd even put the flip flops I was going to wear for the day of the show. I never wore normal shoes. I was a flip flop guy for, you know, the tan and shit. Yeah. Of course. Of course. Those were in my carry on. Like, everything I needed. I could just go to the show with like, you know, my Nike dry fit stuff and my flip flops and my trunks and my everything. Good job. I'd ask them to like, Hey, do you want to get on the phone to make sure you've got everything you need? Put it, you know, list, good list. I said, no, I got it. And then after I got that text, I was like, oh, this is not good. Because I know that feeling of like, you know, just like all of a sudden the world fell apart. And Victoria said to me, she was like, that was the one thing. Like he could have forgotten anything else. Anything, anything. Just that was the one custom thing. The one thing, borrow. Like, you know, you forget your ring light. Okay. You forget your body weight scale, which that's the number one thing I find people forget is their body weight scale, you know, yeah, but the trunk says the one thing. He'll never do that again. You know, no, no, don't bring him on vacation when he doesn't need them. Right. What else did we have in those questions? I know Ron, you saw a couple good ones that really stood out. There were some good ones in there. Yeah. I like those. Yeah. That's these question boxes. Do all right. Yeah. This stands out to you in there, man. I got to find it again. All right. I trusted you. Well, you find it. All right. What changes would you guys like to see in the fitness industry trends, divisions, SUPS, how to deal with someone rating a college essay instead of actually doing a set, et cetera. Thank you for the. Well, we know what there is. Yeah. I think the only, the thing that pops to mind for me that I would like to push to the new generation of bodybuilders is, is having a life outside of bodybuilding. Yes. Like, and I know I'm an old grumpy man, but I was in the gym the other day and there were two girls there training, talking a ton. And I was just like, I just wanted to walk over and go, you're annoying the shit at me. But anyways, could you talk about something other than your chicken breast and your diet and your put like, I just feel like, you know, it's something that I really believe. And anyone who followed me back in the day knows I was 120% bodybuilder. But having things that you do and enjoy outside of bodybuilding will make you a better bodybuilder. Yeah. I agree. It absolutely will. I know I saw this thing. It was actually funny. Matthew Kachuk. His dad was a pro hockey player. He and his brothers are both pro hockey players. Yeah. And he was asked, what is a thing that your parents did that made it possible for you to become professional hockey players? And he said, they wouldn't let me play hockey in the summer. Huh. Yes. Like we could play any sport we wanted except for hockey. He wanted us to hang out with our friends, play baseball, play soccer, do whatever, but we were not allowed to do summer leagues. And that just rings to me because it's like, you got to have something else because you really get burnt out or, you know, I mean, you just won't love it. So I think that's something that more people could lean into now because I know it's got really popular to run your whole life around it and do social media and everything else. Other hobbies will change your perspective and make you a better buddy. I saw an interesting article on that exact thing, Dusty. It was there's a study that actually shows now. You can anyone out there that actually knows what it is can send it to us. But I believe it was kids who play multiple sports who are forced to play multiple sports and exposed to multiple sports actually wind up being better at the sport that they specialize in. Wow. And it's because one of the factors is they think that the kids at those ages are less likely to get burned out by the sport that they're focusing on because you know, if you got a kid playing summer league hockey, it's just all hockey, hockey, hockey, hockey, and you know, kids, kids, you can fry your kid on stuff too early, you know, get them to where they feel like they're trapped in this sport. And that's part of it. And then the second thing was there's just so much to take advantage of as a kid as far as developing their athletic skills and their athletic potential and everything has like such an overlap. Like if you force them, like you expose them to summer sports, then there's other skills that they learn that they then bring back to their overall athletic ability as a hockey player when they start their season again. So there's some interesting research on that like multiple sports are the way to go if you want them to be good at any of those sports. Right. You know what I mean? Obviously, there's an age when we specialize, you know, kids go to the dub. Yeah. It's time to stop playing baseball. Yeah. Yeah. You know what I mean? That's funny that you said that. I think something that I'd like to see as far as having other things going on, I feel like I got away with murder being I know. I got away with kind of livin. I got away with kind of livin. We're not a six views. We're not a six. We didn't even say we're not even talking about any of those things. But it could be miss the food. But I, you know, like I was very single focus bodybuilder only, you know, my whole life was revolving around bodybuilding and stuff. But I was also I was smart enough to know that I had to also like pay attention to my finances because bodybuilding wasn't going to take care of that and stuff. And I feel like I probably would have been an even better bodybuilder had I been even a little more diversified as far as my interests go, you know what I mean? And now that I'm older and I see people getting kind of trapped in the bodybuilding only mindset, I'm like, now I know I survived that. But it didn't go great for everyone. And I don't necessarily recommend that, you know, and I think you should everyone should have a hobby that takes their mind away from bodybuilding. And you should ask yourself, do I have anything that takes me away from bodybuilding? Because I think it's actually a great idea, you know, just something mentally you're out of the you're not thinking about your chicken breasts. I think that that's a mistake and it's going to burn you out much like the young kid that you forced to play summer hockey. You know, so yeah. You know, another thing that I thought of that you guys have probably experienced, but this could be everything, but in bodybuilding, we spend a lot of time talking about ourselves. Yeah. You know, so we'll be at the booth and Nikki laughs because she's, although she's in the sport, she's still an outsider and she'll laugh because I'll see someone I know. And they'll walk up there. Hey, Dusty, so this year I worked on bringing up my glutes and doing this. I just finished and they just puke on me. And then they leave. And she's like, what the hell was that? It's not even a conversation. And I think it's something that you should be mindful of and actually had a friend that was a really good sales guy. And I would notice when he would be around people, they'd be like, hey, Nate, how's your, you know, what's going on with the family? He'd go, all everyone's doing good. And then he'd immediately put it back to them and ask them about them and ask them things. And I realized like he's great to be around. Like he's all and then everyone loves him and no one even realizes why. But it's because he's always reversing. It's always getting back off of him. And I think in bodybuilding, because we are so focused, it's an easy trap to just go on and on and on about yourself. And I find the world is a lot more interesting and especially in bodybuilding. I always laugh because people are like, how's things? And I'm like, dude, I live the same day every day. I'm the most boy person to talk to. So please tell me about you. You know what I mean? But I think that they'll find that they enjoy things better and people won't avoid them. Yeah. Yeah. Try to be a little cognizant of the post-show puke when I think everyone, everyone who's a bodybuilder has done it to someone at least once. Oh, for sure. That's fine. That's fine. We all went through that. I'm sure it did a bunch of times. Try to be aware of if you're doing it and it's not a habit you want to be in. And it's not like a thing you want to have as a constant trait. You know what I mean? And that's like, you know, when someone says, hey, how's it going? Like, they mean you. Like, how is it going? Like, how are you? They don't just mean how's your diet? How's your prep? How's your morning pictures? They don't just mean, in fact, most likely, that's the stuff they care the least about. Yeah. Like, when I ask someone how they're doing, I love hearing an actual answer. Like, oh, I'm doing great, man. You know, blah, blah, blah, blah. But the last thing I want to hear is, like, hey, man, congratulations on the weekend. Yeah, you know, I really going to bring my back and then just this long tirade about their bodybuilding plans that have nothing to do with the moment. I just, you know, I know what you mean, Dusty. Hey, I just got a text from UC Summa. He says, Jordan Hutchinson is right in front of me, training chest with Justin Wyatt right now. Oh, I told him, hey, ask him to come on the show after he's done competing for the season. Yeah. It's a little bit of a mod. Yeah. Absolutely. Well, that won't be till October now. Oh, yeah. Well, maybe before. He'll come on before Justin. Yeah, yeah. Jordan, Jordan will definitely be down. We've shared some cheeseburgers together. We're good. We're tired. Oh, you know him? Yeah. All right. Cool. What about this one then, guys, from Dan Cooley. He says, guys, got first call out, Master's Nats a few weeks ago. Now, the main critique I received was to bring in my glutes and glute tie in better. What are some things besides RDLs and glute bridges that I can do to really bring in those gnarly walnut looking glutes and that deep tie in? Get shredded. Yeah. There's only two things you can do. Add muscle and reduce fat. So if you're, if you have enough muscle there, right? If you're squatting and stiffly deadlifting and doing all the, you know, stuff you're supposed to do to get muscle there, the rest is just get more peeled than you've ever been. Get to where you were at this last show and then drop five more pounds and just, you know, get to where you were at the last show with five weeks left in your prep. And then just like that skin will just get tighter and tighter and tighter. And then you'll wind up, people will wind up telling you, oh, you know, what did you do? And you're like, I just got leaner. Braden talked about that on his Instagram though, and I thought it was great. He said the biggest mistake that a lot of bodybuilders make is their preps are too short. Yeah. And I agree. Like we used to do 12 week preps, especially first time. That was the norm. And now I like to start people at 20 as a minimum. Yeah. I think we used to start a fast prep. We used to start, we used to do the 12. I remember my first show was an 11 week prep. Yeah. I got ripped because we just didn't, you know how people tell you stuff? So you, you think it's a rule? Like you know, the rule like, you gotta lose two or three pounds a week or it's muscle. Yeah. Like I didn't know my first show. I was just, didn't know that rule. Yeah. Just went on a diet. The weight just fell off and I wound up ripped and it was 11 weeks and it was a hard diet. I was starving the whole time. But yeah, I was like five pounds a week. I'll add to if he does need more tissue. I think that bodybuilders, and some people would be surprised to hear this, but I've had two bodybuilders that I work with actually go to Brett Contreras and get programs to train their glutes differently because they didn't have enough tissue. And I'm like, because I want shredded glutes like you had them. Like I have a huge ass. Yeah. You have to bring the tissue there. And trust me when I say they're fighting me tooth and nail because I've got them doing all sorts of weird Brett Contreras glute work in the gym like the bikini girls. I had two guys do that for a year. Yeah. Insanity. If you are it changed my whole view of how it works. I mean, the amount of tissue that two guys that had nothing going on could put on in one year of just adding that stuff in three days a week, mind boggling. So don't be afraid to get outside of your your box. I know a lot of guys and I've been guilty. This will say like we never used to do hip thrust. We just squatted and we just did this throw the rules out the window. If you don't have glutes and you're already doing all that shit, then you better find something else because in bodybuilding, you can also need more glutes if you want to see that kind of detail. And I think that more people should not be afraid to go, okay, I'm going to get weird here and see what happens. I told you guys that that's what I did. But one of my clients, local competitor, I pro Amy Landry bikini competitor. And I was like, Amy, you know, I my glutes sucked like they just never grew. And I was like, I want to come to the gym with you to train glutes. And we like shot video of it and it like made fun of the whole they had fun with the whole thing, you know, but I picked out the things that worked for me and I stuck with them. And I got literally like newbie like gains. And I have like pictures that were like side by side glute shots, you know, the side profile of the glute, like of three months difference. And it was like lights out difference, you know, so what are you doing? What exercises were you doing? That's where, you know, a big one. And with, you know, so here's one that I found really helped me a lot was like pre activation stuff. So I'd start out on the abductor machine. But I'd kind of, you see the bikini girls that kind of like sit forward on the machine, you know, and you kind of envision the top shelf of the glute. A lot of times when you go to do the abductor, it's like a hinge movement and it kind of wants, if you go real heavy, it kind of goes to your hips, you know what I mean? Like right into that joint. But if you go a little bit lighter and you're kind of like sitting forward, but then also kind of have your chest raised, I can target that like upper shelf of the glute and just that mind muscle connection to that alone was a start. So just doing stuff like that and then one legied glute bridges off of a bench. Those three things were like the, the, the mean three that I stuck with. She had me do some crazy stuff that was like way out there that I was like, yeah, I'm not going to stick with these, but those three I could do. And also to side note, if you guys hadn't heard me tell this story before anybody listening, it also fixed my low back issues because it turned out my glutes weren't turning on. So everything when I was doing barbell row stuff like that, my low back was just bracing as hard as it could. More than it could until it couldn't and then I throw my back out, you know, so strengthening the glutes helped to support my bent over movements. Huge. Yeah. Ballad. Yeah. Okay. Nothing ever made my glutes more sore than heavy Bulgarian split squats. Ooh. Yeah. I don't know that that leg you're standing on. Yeah. That glute has to stabilize too because you're only on one leg. I just man, it gets so pumped. Yeah. Real quick one from Lucas says, would you rather eat two burgers or one burger in one fry? Great question. Yeah. Where are we eating these? It matters. Yeah. Where are you at? The fries matter. The fries are either right or left. That's true. Or a band. Yeah. There's plenty of places that's two burgers for me because they're fries suck. But I mean, if you're taking me somewhere that has like a quality fry, burger and fry. Best fry. All time. McDonald's. Do you like a shoe strain kind of a thinner? Those are just when done correctly or you got to be like hot, hot than they are amazing. I'll challenge you. I'll challenge you on that. I'll say Arby's curly fries. Oh, yes. Great choice. But I don't like to make that one. Great choice. Great choice. Yeah. I forget about curly fries when I'm in this argument and then I am like, ooh. And then there's also like for me, I love the, I love a good kind of a fatter skin still on fry. Like the wedge. Yeah. Yeah. You know, like a little fatter like well, no like the five guys ones. Oh, yeah. Normal fries, but they still have the skin on them, but they're not the shoe lace ones, you know, they're not the real. But I like a five guys fry that giant bag of fries that you get. Where you, you know, I went somewhere recently where they instead of salt, they use seasoned salt on them and it was amazing. This good. Yeah, I was like, ooh, next level. If you're at a restaurant, will you guys upgrade to sweet potato fries? Or do you ever do that? No, because Emily gets the sweet potato fries. So I get the normal fries and then I finish her fries and then I get both types. Okay, good call. Yeah, yeah. It all works itself out for me. Yeah. Maths out. I like this. Well, type of life where I get both fries. Yeah. Light shoes. Both fries kind of guy. Yeah. I'm a two fries type of guy. My woman lets me have both kinds. Yeah. My woman shares with me if you know what I'm saying. I'm not allowed to reach across the table. Yeah. What else you got Scott? I'm looking here. I'm looking. Um, don't see what you'd be at the Clash of Charleston in October. Probably not. Okay. I don't leave my house very often. Would you have run? I'm leaving my house tomorrow to go shoot two episodes of Mutant on a mission. Oh, we got. He doesn't know. Yeah, it's come up to something. No, I'm going to. I'm flying to I'm going to two great gyms. Well, I haven't been there yet. It might be shitholes. But they seem like great guys, great gyms, and I've been invited by the owners, which you know, I like to be invited. There's a lot of gyms that they'll message me and go, why haven't you come to my gym? Yeah. You never I go. Well, you've never invited me and you've never messaged me before. But hello, but these guys, both these gyms went out of their way. They came to see me at the booth. They've chatted with me. They watch a show. They're fans of the show. And I'm excited to go see the guys at Prodigy Gym in Denver. Nice. They're in Fort Collins, which will be cool because I've done arm brisk gym in Denver. And then I've never been back to Denver for anything. So I'd love to go back. It's up in Fort Collins. And so I call Prodigy Gym. And it looks like a great setup they got. And then I'm going to Indianapolis. Never been to Indie before. Oh, nice. And I'm going to see Nathan Eppler. Oh, okay. Cool. American muscle factory. Right on. Yeah. So Nathan Eppler messaged me and they came and saw me at the booth. And he was like, man, I love your show. You know, he's a gym owning Pro Bodybuilder. So I got something in common with Nathan trying to run a business and make a good gym for everybody. So I'm excited to go there. I've been to Indianapolis before. Yeah. And so I'm excited. And I needed to catch two episodes of the show. So when I sat down to start lining up flights, it's such a perfect trip. Denver is easy to get to. Lots of flights to Indie. Yeah. It's nice. It worked out really good. I have clients that have trained at that gym. In fact, one of them, I think, was like trying to set you up with him a while ago. So I don't know if that's how this ended up happening. Right. No, that's been ongoing. Okay. Most of the gyms I go to now for Mutant Non-Emission. They've been bugging me at this point. I'm like five years backed up. Yeah. Right. So like the gyms I'm going to now are people that came to see me in 2019 and invite me. Yeah. Because it's, you know, I do eight to 10 episodes a season and I've been invited by like 100 gyms. So what are you going to do? You know, how about this question, guys? So competing against competing against other competitors. Then was it time when you were pumping up and you were just like, well, I lost. Okay. Oh, I remember. I remember going to the North Americans and being like sort of having the mindset like, well, I didn't win the Canada's this year because it was always like two weeks after. Yeah. But I'm going to go to North Americans and make the biggest impact I can. You never know what'll happen, right? Right. Like positive. Like it's going to be the best I can. We'll go see what happens. Sometimes guys come home with wins. Never know what's going to happen, right? Right. I'm always in the kind of top group I always get looked at. Let's go see. And then a keem takes a shirt off backstage. A keem Williams. And you're like, yeah, like I don't need to come to this show. Like it's just really an expense for me to have fun at a show. Like it's me competing for fun. And I don't really need to be here. That was the year that second place was Michael Lockett. Yeah. Yeah. And you're like, I put all this effort in and I took all this gear and I put my body through all this fucking brutal torture for two more weeks. For two more weeks after the show I just did. And then I sat in there looking at a keem. And you're like, what am I doing? Why am I here? It's ridiculous. Mm-hmm. You know, and then a keem easily wins. Like easily. Like, you know, as easy as any regional show you've ever seen in your life. Yeah. That's how he turns the world. That's so easy when that show. Like, you know, it's like everyone's backstage is like, oh, a keem. So yeah, that'd be the last time that happened to me. But yeah. I remember, I mean, I always knew at those levels that chances are there would be someone. But 2010 USA's, I didn't make it to Wayans because I saw Jason Huzz pictures six weeks out. And I was like, all right, well, that's the overall winner. Yeah. Oh, I guess we'll shoot for second. Like, I mean, you knew he, anybody who knows that era, as soon as he released those photos, you were like, he was nuts. He was nuts. This is done. So, but I have so many great, like backstage stories. Actually, at the, at that show, I think you're talking about 2013, right? Yeah. What a keem one. Yeah. So, I was talking to him, um, lock it, and someone else. I can't remember. We were all just talking, waiting to go out. And this kid walks over his eyes are enormous. And he goes, hey, and we turn like, what's up, man? And he goes, what do you guys do? He had won some small show and just showed up to North Americans and his whole life changed backstage. He's like, oh, it's funny because my friend Daniel, he's won the past week about two years ago. He told me, the first time he went to you to North Americans, he goes, this is where bodybuilding dreams go to die. Yeah, they did. Yeah. I didn't even, that's a great. I just went to a good state level show. There was the Titan classic. And I, I knew I was like, okay, so I'm a state level guy. And why don't I, I, you know, I don't have a schedule. I can do whatever shows I want. Why don't I pick one out of state? I was like, why don't I pick one in Southern California? Because then I can go to like, train at golds and stuff like that. So that's what I did. And I did the 2017 Titan classic. And I remember it like it was kind of, it was cool because it was like, it was, it was one of tamers shows. So I met him there. Yeah, great. And I remember like, I was supposed to bring up my registration. And instead I had, I pulled like the wrong thing out of my bag. And I had like my flight information and I handed it to him. And like, in front of a room full of people that were all sitting down. He was like, is there anybody that don't have their registration? And I was like, oh, yeah, me and I reached my backpack and walking. And I'd be like, no, this is your flight information, son. So that was funny. But good start. And that same room, everybody, you know, gets ready to weigh in then at the end of that. And I can't remember his name for the life of me right now. But he put it this way after that show, he went to nationals in one. He worked with me, Loas. And now he competes in the two 12, like legit instantly was it. Two 12 competitor, but he was the guy who peeled down in front of me to get on the scale. And he was in my class as a late heavyweight. He didn't have to peel down. I just saw his calves and then I saw his wads. And I was like, oh my God. And then I saw his back. And I was like, this dude is legit a pro already, you know, yeah. He's winning the whole thing. My the guy who used to own I force Dave Nelson. He had that same thing. He was doing the what's the show, the border states back in the day. And he was he'd won some shows. So he's like, you know, he's going to win. And he's like, you know, he was peeled. Everything was on point. And he said at weigh-ins, he sees this guy and he peels down. And he's like, what the fuck is that? And he's just nuts. And he's like, you know, he starts to ask him like where he's from. He's like, oh, I'm not from the States. I just came in. They invited me to come do the show. And he's like, oh, lovely. Dennis James. So when Dennis James flies over from another country to kick the shit out of it's a rough day at the office. He's like, yeah. And then you know, it's bad when it weigh-ins. They're like pushing him to go do the, the nationals. It's just too national this year. Right. You know, like this show hasn't even happened yet. They're like, anyways, this is over. Let's move on to nationals. Yeah. There's that guy. I think everyone has that though. You know, those moments, I remember Chris Cook told me that he did nationals the first time and he had won like the Anchorage and he smoked everybody. So we went down to nationals and he was running late for weigh or not for weigh-ins, but to get on stage and he runs back to the back and he sees all these guys lined up and he goes, oh my God. When did the heavies go? And the guy goes, what do you mean they haven't went yet? He goes, well, why are you all lined up? The guy goes, we're middle weights and he goes, that's when I knew I spent $2,000 to watch a bodybuilding show. Yeah. He thought he was talking to super heavy weights and they were middle weights. And he was like, oh shit. As well. So it was Remi Berminga who does a lot of the shows around here and told me his story. I mentioned it to you guys a long time ago. I believe it was Jim Quinn who was weighing in front of him. And it was the Remi said it was the year he was like, I went all out. Like I really pushed this year. I put on a lot more weight and I knew like I'm coming in the heaviest I'd ever been and he was just like, he was just like over the heavy weights. You know, he's just like standard heavyweight. I don't know what he was 220 or something like that. And anyway, he says then, then Quinn gets out, gets on the scale in front of him and he's like 60 pounds heavier than Remi is. And he turns around and looks at Remi. But both of his hands and his shoulders is go big or go home, right? Remi. He was like, oh god. After all that, like I'm really going to do it this time. I put all my heart into it. You know, push just heavy as I could get. That rolls in at 280. Jim Quinn. Who's either Jim Quinn or Mike Quinn? I can't remember which one it was. I could have been either one of them. Right. Yeah. That's exactly what both of them would have done. Yeah. I also love the turned around and gave that to him. That's fantastic. Yeah. Go home or go big or go home, Remi. Yeah. Yeah. Right. I've told this, I've told the story before, but one of my favorite, like, sort of a guy coming in and winning a show was my second show. And I went there thinking I was big. I'd won my first show. So I went to my second show. I was like, ah, here we go. You know, I'm big. I weighed in at 250, right? Should have weighed in at 235, but we didn't at 250. Thinking I was big. And there was this guy at the Wayans who had this giant beard and a big ponytail. And he like looked really rough. Like he hadn't like his beard wasn't trimmed. It was like unshaven, homeless like, yeah, right. Full out. And he looked small. He wasn't big. And they called heavy weights and he stood up. And I was like, he barely looks like he weighs 200 pounds. And there was me and this other big dude and this other guy that was like 230 and like couple of 250 pounders and me and this other big dude, we all stand up for heavy weights. And this before there was a supers. And so we all go and get in line and we start weighing in. And then that dude's right in front of me and he strips down. And he's the skinless, like just this anatomy chart of striations that steps on. He steps on the scale, standing relaxed. Glutes are completely ripple chips. He threw skin. Yeah. I'm like, oh, I've lost the show. This guy's going to destroy it. So good to go. And then and then he weighs in at like 202. Yeah. Barely 200 pounds. And then the next day I go back to my hotel and I'm like, God, that guy was so ripped. Maybe that can beat everyone but him. Right. And then the next day we're back backstage getting ready. Like heavy weights, you know, and he shows up. And he's shaved his face. Okay. Over over the course of the night. Oh, yeah. And his hair was long. He had this long. That's what he had long like cone in hair. And he showed up the next day and it was pulled back tight in a little top knot. And then he had his face shaved totally clean. And it was like like a dead skeleton. And he rolls in and starts posing backstage to like get going. And he's tricep horses. Yeah. Yeah. And then afterwards I said, what do I got to do to get as ripped as you and he goes, oh, that's my coach. And he introduced me to his coach Brian and then I won the next year. Ah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I used that coach and I won the next year. Yeah. Nice. Yeah. Just that shock, you know, and see him shaved face the next day and realize his face was like a skeleton. Like a dead person. I was like, oh, oh, God. Yeah. Had he been shaving the day before you would have known before he was hitting a big beard, right? Yeah. And then you see the face the next day and you're like, oh, I wouldn't know enough. I would have just, you know, I could have taken that loss earlier. Yeah. A lot of times at the state level shows, especially it's not the biggest guy that you have to worry about. And I learned that shows up like that. I remember seeing guys that were just like massive and close. And I'm like, oh my God. That guy's three times my size and you get on stage with him and you didn't never have to worry about him. He just wasn't in shape. You know, it's the little guys, you know, that and you learn that. It's interesting when you work with somebody who's never competed before. And they're like, well, I want to come in as big as possible. I'm like, no, no, you have what you have. You want to come in as lean as possible. You want to freak people out with how lean you are because you're not going to get any bigger between now and the show. I mean, you like grow a little bit. Yeah, grow into the show blah, blah. But it's not like a Laverone thing. You need to get absolutely lights out peeled, you know, and they learn that though. Because then you go to the show and then you realize like, oh, it wasn't the biggest guys. Who won? It was the best guys, the leanest guys, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. That's good time, though. Absolutely. Good eye openers. I think that was a good place to call it. It was a wrong story. What do you guys think? It was a long show. It's good. Solid. Yeah. You know, I feel like we're given the people something. Some some value. We hit six competitors. I don't want to hear this. That was phenomenal. Except for Dusty with his terrible crappy comments on social media. Exactly. The you got a lot of editing to do is you should probably start now. Oh, we said so many things that did not like we were not intentionally saying like, you know, but there was like 10 times today. So I might just leave it as a test. You know, when it came up, would would rod drop the M word? I was like, oh, no. Yeah. Yeah. He didn't even mean it in that way either. Yeah. Find a way. I find a way. Okay. Quick before we go, I got to say to Scott, we are enjoying Fargo. Oh, we are. We are however in season four, which is the 1950s Chris Rock season. Oh, yeah. And it's definitely a little slower moving. The season has been like weird, a little weird. Like there's a lot going on with these Italians and the black guys. Yeah. It's yeah. Yeah. There really is. And but I know there's a payoff. And I know that season five is supposed to be apparently amazing with John Ham. Season five is the only season that you could watch that it doesn't tie in. It's from what I understand it doesn't have any tie-ins with the the right. This one's but it has the same feel, the same vibe, the same types of people. Now that you know that area of the world and the types of people that existed, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, as to what you're watching. And now are they done the show or is there a season six coming? I heard there might be, but I mean, it's been done, done. So also, have you seen the brothers that train at your gym since we talked? Yeah. They were on the show. Yeah. Remember I remember I told you that to tell you. Yeah. Yeah. What did you say? Yeah, the two brothers. Yeah, but did you see them since? Yeah. Have you seen it? No, I haven't seen them yet. The train in the morning and I haven't seen them yet. But today's a holiday. Yeah. And the gym's always a real mix up on the holiday. Okay. When it's training in weird hours and I'm going in right after this. So if I see them, yeah, Brad and Todd, if you see them, tell them that I'm a huge fan. And I'm going to ask, could you get a picture with them for me? I'm going to try to get a picture of them in their outfits. Signed for you. I'm going to see if I can get one. Yeah. That would be epic. Yeah. I'm going to see if they have one. You don't even know me. That show goes down in history as one of my favorite TV shows ever. It really does. Yeah. We just saw the episode where the, you know, the lunatic Italian brother. Oh, yeah. Remember when he's in that bar with that kid in that bartender and he gets a little frustrated?

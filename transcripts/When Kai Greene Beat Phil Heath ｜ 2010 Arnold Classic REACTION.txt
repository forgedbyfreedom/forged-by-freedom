 Look at that jaw muscle, the mandible on my green. I never would have noticed that. The ticket's got a mouth full of food. Yeah, no, that's just from chewing 80 pounds of meat. Yeah, the way he used to eat, that makes sense. Look at everybody there. Look at branch, it's front relax. It's funny, because at the show, I think I was in peer fan mode. And I thought Kai was winning pretty significantly. Yeah. And watching this video back, I'm like, yeah, I definitely would have had Phil winning in the morning. I don't know what happened at night, but I mean, so it was close. Phil got a seven, and Kai got a 10 in pre-judging. Then in finals, it went the other way. Kai got a five, and Phil got a 13 straight first. And that means that Phil had some thirds in it. Yeah, yeah. There's a one and two right there. See, if that Phil shot has to be for the morning, because if he felt that far, he didn't look like that at night. And I mean, I could see Phil winning that right there. Oh, Phil looks nasty hard, too, doesn't he? Look at him on the top. His separation in his arms is ridiculous from the front. Hey, everybody. Welcome to It's Just Bodybuilding. We're back for a re-ax. Yes. Yes. We haven't done one of these for a while, so I'm very excited. We have on Dex Scott, the 2010 Arnold Classic. I'm very excited. I'm Big Ron Partlow. This is Dusty Hansha. And of course, the producer Scott McNally, remember to like, share, subscribe, comment, and ring the bell. Iamutin.com, get your hardcore ISO, get your mind if K and everyone should get on the gear. Dusty and Ron, Dusty and Big Ron are your codes. Don't forget, save money, avoid people, get stuff delivered fast. OK, 2010, Arnold Classic. Why are we looking at this, Scott? Because this is one of the rare moments that Kai Green beat Phil Heath. I think the only moment. Is it? Is it B? I thought there might have been possibly one other. Yeah, you're right. It only happened once or twice, maybe. But it's rare. And what we have here, this is footage that Mike Pulse-Anella had shot. So this is, here's the thing. It's not like the full-on camera of everybody. He's definitely, like, I think he's using this for like B-Roll footage. I thought he had a tree. Exactly where he's going to say, you know, Kai put a lot into this and everything was on the line. Is he zooming in on his face? You know what I mean? So I think there's that element. You know what I mean? I think that's going on. But it's still in the competition when he realizes. Yeah, that's probably going to be cool. Exactly. But it's beautifully shot. Like the, yeah, yeah, it looks really good. And it's just the pure raw footage. So I thought this would be fun. You want to blow that up? Let's see if I can. Yeah. Well, just so it fills its own screen. Let's see what I can do here. I just hit the little square right there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There was that. All right. Damn. Look at that. Such a lineup, man. Dexter, Phil, Branch, Kai. What an era of bodybuilding. I was at the show. Were you? Yep. I was not at this show. I hadn't signed with Mutant yet. I wasn't traveling to the Arnold. Oh, no kidding. Yeah. God. Look at everybody there. Look at Branch's front relaxed. Damn. So it's funny. This is 2010. Phil, Phil Windsia Olympia in 2011. Yep. OK. He still puts on a lot of size from this. Oh, yeah. Ton. I always loved watching Kai just move through the poses. Even his quarter turns, it was posing involved in it. Yeah. And this is what I mean here, where he has him zoomed in. Yeah. You can picture Mike saying something right now. So we don't get to see everybody. But the footage we do see is absolutely incredible. Look at that jaw muscle, the mandible on a green. I never would have noticed that. Let's think he's got a mouthful of food. Yeah, no, that's just from chewing 80 pounds of meat. Yeah, the way he used to eat, that makes sense. Yeah. And I did preview this. So I know that he zooms back out. And we do get to see every single one. No one worry. Yes. It's arms are out of control. Thanks for it. This is like the peak of Kai, right? I mean, where everyone was on board. Yeah. The storyline. What year was his Vegas video overkill? Oh, those years later, was it? I think that was a great video. By the way, he did an awesome job with that person. I did. That was really good. I used to watch all those while doing cardio. And then even the edits on YouTube that people did with him. That was Kai Green started the documentary overkill in 2010. It was this year. Oh, so it was the same year. So it was like after this show. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, there was a look at that lineup. Ooh, yeah. Branches, adductors. So you got, yeah. So I'm just thinking here, Phil never won an Arnold Diddy. He never needed to. I don't think so, because the following year when the Olympia then never came back. Yeah. Branches had one at this point. I assumed that he wound up getting two. Dexter wound up getting what? How many Arnold classics did Dexter win? I thought he got, I thought he had at least four, but I can't remember. Because there's a lot of titles up there. Kai has two, right? Yep. Now, from what I've read, I try to fill these notes. Phil actually beat him in pre-judging, but Kai came back and beat him at finals. Right. That and close. Yeah, that's bananas. It's amazing what Phil did to gap the competition between him and Kai after this year though. Like, I was at this show too, by the way. Yeah, it really was. Yeah. Phil's arms are just still probably the silly stuff. That's a threat, please. That's your brother. Not going anywhere yet. Freaked brand. Just a whole gnarly and nasty looking. Here we go. What do you got here? Tony Freeman. Ronnie Rekal. Ronnie Rekal. Yep. Yeah, Ryan Rekal look great there. Oh, he always looked nuts to me. Just phenomenal. Phil glows. Do you see that? Hold on a minute. I'm going to roll this back here if I can just a second. Look at the look. It's kind of scary. Hold on. I got to go back just a little bit further than that. Watch Phil's look when he looks at Dexter. He knows that Dexter is going to come over. Watch this. Just this is like a great freeze frame. Hey, let's move. Hi, Dexter. Hi, Dexter. He just look. I didn't catch it on time, but he just made eye contact with Dexter for just a split second. You got to come over and stand next to me. All right. So what was the final place in this show? Kai won. I can't remember who was second. Phil was second. The branch. Brand. Dexter Jackson. Tony Freeman. Ronnie Rekal. Rolly Winkler. Heeta Tata Yamagishi. Melvin Antholinene. So Dexter won five Arnold's like Arnold. Okay. Classics 050608. 13 and 15. So he spent a decade winning Arnold classics. Phil just glows. He's got like the skin tone is so perfect on stage. It's funny because at the show, I think I was in pure fan mode and I thought Kai was winning pretty significantly. Yeah. And watching this video back, I'm like, yeah, I definitely would have had Phil winning in the morning. I don't know what would happen at night, but I mean, so it was close. Phil got a seven and Kai got a 10 in pre-judging. Then in finals, it went the other way. Kai got a five and Phil got a 13. Straight first. And that means that Phil had some thirds in there. Yeah, yeah. Phil didn't have straight seconds either. So branch took a couple knocks off him, which is crazy. You know, I'll talk about that that happened, you know. Especially being in a seven, that means he was, you know, just too off of perfect in the morning. I would love to see that video now to see how much he changed. Yeah. They weren't good at like moving guys out back then. Steve will like yell out and spray out. Yeah, playing a room on that stage. I think there is a little more showmanship too. Yeah, it is. Like they make it more fun, you know, right? They bring out like the top two, you know, and they mix it up. They don't typically bring guys out after the first four though, like they did here. You know, yeah, they evenly don't add like add to that lineup. I know what you mean. They'll put a couple guys away too because sometimes you've got the guys that you don't have and then all of a sudden they move up. Oh, the caps and hands are just silly. The muscle belly is unkired. It's all so cartoony like you really are. You know what I mean? Just the lats go down. So look how thick the lower lats are and just like this is a crazy. Those lats are just so sick. That's like five inches thick at the back when he's squeezing like that. Yeah. You know, a scootalo, Mike. Would you? Yeah. Yeah, this is all Mike's B roll. Yeah, which is kind of cool. Like I know this isn't a lot of people might be thinking, oh, I'm not seeing the lineup, but this is like what Mike filmed for for Kai. So it's kind of neat that it's like he wanted a headshot for the whole thing that he could cut to, you know, yeah, but we did get to see him pull back a little bit. I know there's another channel that has some of the video. There's like some real crappy footage. Check this one out. Let me find it more here. Hey guys. This guy has some stuff. He nominated his stuff up because he's got some great. Look at it. Look at these shots here. Yeah, open that up. Scott with a little box. All right. There we go. There we go. That's the backstage. Yeah, it's about. That was what the backstage were talking about on the other show in the very, very back right there. That's the normal. Yep. There we go. There's a one in there's a one in two right there. See if that fill shot has to be for the morning because if he felt that far, he didn't look like that at night. And I mean, I could see Phil winning that right there. Oh, yeah. Like Phil looks nasty hard, too, doesn't he? Look at him on the top. His that separation in his arms is ridiculous from the front. Yeah. You literally see all the way to the armpit, the insertions on the biceps. The arms are insane. The side legs and both of them. Yeah, yeah, for real. Kai there looks like a horse like a side of that. It's a man it's our shit going on here. That's his most muscular is to me the nastiest ever. Yeah, I was going to say, would you put that into like one of the best most muscular is ever? I will be best. V best. There's a whole bunch of Phil's poses that are just like we've talked about after Phil retired and we all looked back, you're like, he was way better than most people gave him credit for. Yeah, I even was winning. He wasn't getting the love he deserved. That very busy era. Like there was a lot going on when Phil was champ. There was a lot of great guys. There was a lot of other stuff to pay attention to. Yet Kai green just being Kai and Branch was still at top of his game and there was just a lot going on and looking at hindsight, I'm like, oh Phil was just. I think the problem also Ron is because we were we were in that era of just loving Jay so much that whoever the predecessor was, you just automatic or like fuck that guy. As if it's his fault that he surpassed Jay and obviously did. You know, for everything from the past getting knocked for having like the bubble got look at Phil right here, I would say that look, that stomach would hang by today's standards. Like there's nothing about them sticking out, you know what I mean? That physique shows up at the Olympia. The show wins. Wouldn't that be incredible? Yeah, these had to be pre-judging. Look at that size of that cheese. Look at that branch worn over there. It looks incredible. I mean, yeah, like it's even arguable that Branch wins this. Yeah, that's like sure. I mean, it's not, it could be argued, you know what I mean? Am I right that Branch is out muscling everybody on stage right now? Sure looks like it. That angle. Yeah, Phil's posing got way better. Now that I'm like looking at this particular shot, like his front double is just got, I don't even know he got better as well, but how he was hitting it got better too. Yeah, yeah. Is there any video like this one? There's a video over Stillzo because like not everyone's fully in their shots when you're hitting all these. Right. Look at Dexter on the left there, like you know he pulls that stomach tight. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I always loved Kai's front last breath and always hated his rear last breath. Right. I didn't feel like it showed correctly. There's more Manitar shot. There we go. Yeah. I'll get ready for this. Yeah. Great lineup for those guys. Great lighting too on that stage, you know, man. I always thought outside of the Iron Man, it was the best. So I mean on the lat, like it has no like depth to it in the back. Look at Branch's traps all the way down to Lombard. Yeah. How is that? Also, if you notice like, you know, Branch kind of lost his lower lats over the years. There's a lot of guys do that maybe get beat up a little bit of cervical spine compression or whatever. Like I've got the one lat that's all fucked up. But he loses his lower lats like between, you know, this, what's this 2010? Yeah. Yeah, between 2010 and like, you know, 2012, 13, they start to kind of get a little shoulder on them. Still wins another. Still wins another Arnold. Still wins too. Kai's not in his shot there. Branch is packs on a side tricep for stupid. Like how does that make sense? His far pack looks enormous. Right. Great shot. Yeah, I'm going to say branch out muscles everybody. And I never at the time would have thought that I always would have thought like Kai was just the guy packing on the most size. And maybe it's the picture. Maybe it's he's standing an inch closer. I don't know. Again, it's packs on in saying, I haven't thought. Like, yeah, your packs look good with your arms over your head. There's a make sense. Defying science right now. Should we go here we go? Here we go. Yeah, as he fill, fill gets a lot bigger. Yeah, oh, yeah. Yeah. Like, you know, because I thought feel like crushes that pose. And in like 2012, 13, 14 when he's Mr. Olympia, it's like, oh, yeah. Yeah, that's that's supposed nobody else wants to hit next one. Yeah, such a good shot. Dexter's crab was always nuts the way the traps come blowing out. Oh, yeah. I think that was it. Yeah, these are nuts. These are great shots. It was such a good show, wasn't it? Oh, it was fantastic. Just just that call out right there is like you feel bad for judges. Yeah, like, how are you supposed to judge that? I mean, and to think that Dexter isn't in the conversation with those three. Yeah, in that. I mean, he was fourth. Like, I'd loved to, I'd loved to know his scores. So I have to assume he was like straight fourths. Dexter got a, let's see, pre-judging he got a 16 and then he got a 20 at finals. Oh, sorry, wasn't I mean, he was right up here. So he got some thirds in. Yeah, pre-judging. Yeah, yep. And Tony Freeman was 25 and 25. Branch got a 19 and a 13. So he moved way up at finals. Yeah. 19 was pre-judging in 13 was finals. Yep, yep, damn. And then once again, Phil was a seven at pre-judging in a 13 at finals. Kind of be a 10 and a 5. That'd be a great video is to show them side by side against themselves and hear those numbers. You know, yeah, when I look at Phil and those shots you're thinking, okay, he's winning and he was. Yeah. What the hell happened before the next day? Yeah. Yeah, because they do it the next day back then, right? It was two days. I like to remember. Saturday? I was it? I think the one was. Saturday, yeah, morning and it was the same day. But a lot can happen in, you know, 10 hours, right? Not to mention, like, waiting for a Treppi's artist to finish their routine. I was so annoyed when we go to shows because I'm like, the restaurants are closing and no one wants to. Only the I liked was when they did this strong man, like the final event on stage. Yeah. That was cool. But I don't want to see this. No one does. We're like, let's go. Yeah. I remember what year, Dexter 2015, Dexter won his last one. And I got given tickets to go. And I went and I was with Manny. Remember Manny? Yeah, absolutely. We were like heading to the show. We had tickets and then we ran into these people that he knew and they were all speaking Spanish. I didn't know what was being said. And then all of a sudden, Manuel's like, give me your tickets. I get you a better seat. And because he wanted to sit with his friends and I was like, I don't care. I'll sit by myself. I don't care. And so they pulled the tickets so they could all sit together because he wanted to sit with his friends. Yeah. And then I said, I don't care. I'll just take whatever tickets left. And I got this one off. And I thought I was kind of taking a hit for the team. Right. You know, Manny can too with his friends. He hasn't seen for a while. And I'll just sit where I don't give a shit. And I walk in and I look at my ticket and the lady puts her flashlight on it. And she goes, oh, follow me. And I'm like, oh, triple A. What's this? Front row. Right in the middle. Wow. I'm like, oh my god. So this one, the guy had a one-off solo ticket. And he didn't want to sit by himself. He wanted to sit with everyone and say, oh, and I got the, yeah. You won that one. So I sit on it and I'm wearing a gasp t-shirt. And I'm looking. Everyone in my row is wearing a suit. Of course. Of course they are. Dorian's behind me. Behind me. Behind me. I'm like, I look around Dorian and he goes, hey, Manny. I'm like, dates. Oh, shit. I'm in front of Dorian. Oh, shit. And then the judges are a couple rows behind us. At the table. Yep. And then they walk out and I am dead. Said, I'd best seat in the whole fucking house. That's me. And it's Dexter and Branch for this crazy showdown. And I took a bunch of pictures on my phone, which was what year would that have been. iPhone three or something. Yeah, those were not good quality pictures. Well, at the time. Close. At the time. So I take a bunch of pictures of Branch right, like filling the screen, like the way a story would look. Yeah. And then I just text them to them. And I just send them away, like I in my seat. And then about three days later, like after it's all settled down, I get some text from Branch. Thanks for the pictures, man. That's awesome. So he did get them. But I did. It is what a crazy showdown was. It was so awesome. And then Brian Shaw came out and did the last strong man event. Oh, the single arm single arm dumbbells. Yeah. How many times can you pick it up, press it, drop it, pick it up, press it, drop it any of a minute. Yeah. And so everyone's coming out doing like three reps for reps. Brian Shaw comes out, alternate arms. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I did alternate arms. Boom, boom, boom. Crushed everyone. Like triple their reps. And everyone else just got like, dogged by Brian Shaw. I remember the funniest part was they brought out all the strong men to give them like standing ovation because it was over with, right? Yeah. They bring out all the strong men. And there's five of them that are out. We got ice packs on their knees. Oh, yeah. We're in a swing. Yeah. We were in a swing. Yeah. What happened to these guys today? Jesus. It's like a third of the class. It's gone. Yep. So yeah. Great time. That's cool. The only better seats are like right up front. They've got like actual not recliners, but they're like those plush front row seats. And I don't I think you have to be like Arnold. You know what I mean to say those chairs. I don't remember the eyes. Nobody I know is ever sat in those. I actually don't remember how nice my chair was. I just couldn't believe where it was. Like you know, I mean, crazy. I didn't know if he had a chair. He just. Yeah. Yeah. That's crazy. Yeah. I would have sat there by myself happily for any show. I would have sat there by myself. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, thanks guys. It was fun. I hope you enjoyed the trip down memory lane and a little bit of reaction. Yes. And I like when we do stuff and then people say, Hey, you know, that was really awesome. I never really knew about that. Or would you know what I mean? Like a lot of people come into bodybuilding in 2011, 2012, 2013. There's a lot of people don't even know Kai. I know some hardcore bodybuilders that compete and they're like, Yeah, I don't know. Was Kai green good? Did you see Kai green? I'm like, Oh, wait a minute. I forget. Oh. I'm like, Oh, wait a minute. I haven't even heard a single cardio confessional. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You don't know all the spiritual stuff that can happen. You know how difficult would be to ask him a basic question, like, Yeah, you don't know the 20 minute response. I remember one term he had was being in the trenches of the experience. Yeah. I would say that sometimes. I'm in the trenches among the experience right now. Funny is like I am the most basic person ever and I used to love watching him and I just, I still liked listening to his long yammering about nothing. Oh yeah. He's cool. It's fine. We didn't get any characters at the time in bodybuilding, you know, so it was like, I'd take it for sure, man. Yeah. Everybody else was like really, I mean, I love Jay, but Jay was like, yeah, you know, I ate some egg whites in the morning. And you know, I don't know, Ron. I don't know. It just worked, Ron. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I still remember the first time I really chatted with Kai, we were having dinner. I got, we ran into Robin, Daniel and Bailey and they were eating with Kai. So we just made one big table. Yeah. And I wound up sitting across from him and I couldn't help but ask him a few questions. Yeah. And every question I asked him was like a 20 minute story. And then I would kind of like, well, I don't want to like eat all the time at the table because everyone's talking so I would wait and there would be some dead space. And I'm gonna ask kind of a question. And then so when we were done dinner, George from mutant, he's like, that was awesome. You just interviewed Kai for an hour. Yeah. Oh, I think he told me that story. That's three questions. Yeah. Three questions. He's gonna make a certain hour. I'm like, I didn't mean to interview Kai at the table like that. And he's like, hey, that's what happened. You do that with people though. That's, you don't intentionally do it, but you do that with people. So you're like, you look at him and you kind of figure out something to ask him and then he gets him going. Yeah. You know, I like asking people to talk about themselves. I like getting in. What's going on with this dude? You know? Yeah. So that's good. And that's when he told me it was right after generation Ironsea, he's like, yeah, you know, they really made me out to be, you know, I felt bad for Philly. He really took a hit. You know, like he even said that. I was like, oh, okay, because you know, we didn't know the story yet. It was kind of new-ish. Yeah. So we haven't heard all the behind the scenes. Everyone had seen the movie, but we hadn't heard like of what they did to make it, you know. How far they twisted it to make it. They followed me for three days and that's what they used. You know, yeah. So did you guys go to the theater to see that movie? Yes. I did too. Yeah. I probably brought a gallon jug with me, you know? Just so I can see. I drew it during that tour or film. It's important. I remember nobody was more upset than Ben Pekolsky. Oh, yeah. He was like, they followed me for three days. They filmed an entire leg workout, which was absolutely sick. I squatted five plates for like 17 reps or something. Like he just said some, he's like, I trained legs to like last an eternity on video. Like I was like, they're going to get the leg workout. They're going to see why my legs look the way they do. Right. Yeah. And then in the movie, they used the laboratory curl. Yeah, that's all they showed. Like you would think that's sprint. You would think that's all he did. You know, they showed him playing golf. Ben was like, fuck. Everyone thinks I'm an idiot. Everyone thinks I just like go to a lab coat guy and do a curl. That's what I thought. Yeah, that's funny. Watch in that. No. That's fine. Okay. Well, that you guys roll. Remember everybody, I am mutant.com. Get your hardcore ISO. Get your mind FK and everyone should get on the gear. We say this over and over. If you're not listening to us, you're just failing. And remember to like, share, subscribe, comment, and ring the bell. There we go. Thanks everybody. Another reacts. And remember, it's just bodybuilding. Okay.
